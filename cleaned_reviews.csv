1,"The Darkness is a very dark story of loneliness and despair.  The story teller does an exceptional Jon of dragging you, kicking and screaming, toward the darkness forcing you to face your fear of being secluded and alone in a vast empty world.  I would recommend taking this journey to the edge of sanity and explore the fear lying just inside the shadows of the Forrest.",Darkness smothers your soul with despair forcing your courage to find the light
2,"This was touted as being very much like the Discworld novels of Prattchet. While it wasn't a bad read, it doesn't even begin to approach Prattchet's character development and nuance. Disappointing from that aspect. I'd certainly have liked it better if I hadn't been misled by other reviews. Surely not the Author's fault.",This was touted as being very much like the Discworld novels of Prattchet
3,"This is an impressive book for such a young writer. I was captivated from the first chapter and really enjoyed the way the characters and storyline developed. The writing needs tighter editing in places, but that will come with further experience. I think young adults would really warm to this story, and the cliffhanger ending whets the appetite to learn more.",I was captivated from the first chapter and really enjoyed the way the characters and storyline developed
4,"I think maybe too much detail on the sufing, I found not so interesting. BUT....it got really good. The ending was quite interesting. The last several chapters, I didn't want to put it down. The ending makes you really think..it can be interpreted different ways. The author tells you his thoughts on the ending and includes a link to it in the electronic copy.",Unexpected two stories that combine toward the end. I like it.

6,"I flew through this book!!!

Abby writes a focused, fun and gutsy account of starting her business. I love how she gave us the real look at the hard parts as well as the amazing parts of her entrepreneurial adventure from 2012 through 2017.

Shes enthusiastic and honest. I winced through some of the stories and wanted to hug her in other stories. Even though we have more resources to start a business, its still hard and risky. Abby shows the importance of persistence, asking questions and having a support network.

Definitely a book I will re-read!","A great real story of the ups, downs and everything in between!!!"
7,"I promise that any fantasy reader will absolutely love this series. When I say this it may sound silly but this book series absolutely changed my life in the best way possible. I absolutely fell in love with the characters, story and setting. I am currently finishing the last book and am in still in awe of how amazing J.K Rowling writes. I truly believe these books are amazing and I really mean it.",I promise that any fantasy reader will absolutely love this series
8,"I guess I was just hoping for too much.  The book is full of logical inconsistencies and anecdotal evidence, despite claiming--in at least one part of the book--scientifically prove the existence of God.

9,"Having read most of the books written by this author, this one seemed a little far fetched.
I couldn't help thinking that this was a rush job that would wrap everything up with a neat little bow and bring this to an end.
While I've come to expect a great deal of violence from the other books, there were times when this book seemed to use it just for the shock value

10,"This is the first book that I read by BEE and it is definitely one of my top five favorite books of all time. It is absolutely nothing like the movie and that's a good thing. I couldn't put it down. It was a very quick and easy read but heavy and dark in atmosphere with each chapter pushing the shock limit. If you love good things and not mainstream fluff, I highly recommend it.",... and it is definitely one of my top five favorite books of all time
11,"This book caught me from the description and had me thinking about it all day as I worked after I started it.  Roselle is a very compelling main character and the author does a great job building her personality so you understand her and her motives.  You route for her as she forges her own destiny, fighting against the system that has used her as propaganda for her whole life.  She fights for what she thinks is right, even when her allies don't agree.  If you pick up this book you won't regret it.",I had a hard time going back to work after starting this on my break.

13,"I read another review and was so disappointed that I almost didn't make this purchase.  The review couldn't have been more wrong.
Once I picked up the book, I couldn't put it down and finished it in one evening.  Cursed Moon is a fast-paced, intelligent read.  I particularly enjoyed how the characters continue to develop in real, meaningful ways.

This cover looks like it could be for the book ""Manspalining Cooking: Let Me Show You How to Chop off Your Fingers."" Nope. No thank you.

15,"I'll throw my review on the pile of the many positive reviews of this book. This book grabbed me and didn't let go. I seriously had to spend every extra minute I had reading it. I haven't felt that way since, I don't know, the first time I read Lord Of The RIngs?

Everything here struck me just right. I loved the plot, the romance, the suspense. You really feel like you're there.

I haven't read Stephen King for a long time, but I'm going to grab a couple more of his books to see if I can get that feeling I got from this book again, because wow.","Time travel, suspense, romance: all in one book and it works!"

17,"This book was difficult to follow.  Especially the character names and to whom they were related, and backtracking on a Kindle is a bit more of a challenge than with a book....

But to change and improve the future, truth is necessary.",maybe what might seem like a bad decision by someone in charge

How am I suppose to enjoy anything without any pictures to entertain me!? Maybe I should have had my mom just read it to me since I didn't graduate school.......",How am I suppose to enjoy anything without any pictures to entertain me
19,"More patriotic drivel.

I swear the author used the word ""Seal"" at least once per page, just in case I forgot I was reading a book about Seals and whose title has the word ""Seal"" as at the start. I guess that would be good if I suffered from Alzheimers or lacked anything resembling a short-term memory.

The author doesn't even try to help you suspend your disbelief and the worship of country and military is constant and in your face while the characters are flat with each filling the requisite niche for smart guy, quiet guy, joker, etc. etc. etc.","Save your money, there's far better available from numerous authors including self-published stuff."
20,"Fantastic read, Andrew J. Morgan's best work yet. The story is futuristic yet believable and poses interesting premises. Something unusual is unearthed deep below Central Park and suddenly the authorities are very interested. One man holds the key to unraveling the mystery but he will have to go up against seemingly unstoppable forces to do what he thinks is right. But is it?",Bet you can't put this one down! Sci-fi at its best: riveting and thought provoking.
21,"I SUPER loved this book. It was a fun read from the start - great sense of humor and strength in the main female character, and the leading man was definitely to die for. Frustratingly fun twists with the time travel angle, and I appreciated that the author made the whole time travel ability scientific vs. solely ""magical"" to add that possibility feel. I laughed, I cried, and I wanted to go back to Scotland!","Wonderful Read if You Love Highlanders, Science, and Scotland!"
22,"IT WAS A CAPTIVATING STORY. I'M SURPRISED IT'S DESCRIPTION SAID, ""INDIE BOOK"". I'LL DEFINITELY LOOK THE AUTHOR UP TO SEE IF HE FOLLOWS UP WITH MYCAH, THE MAIN CHARACTER WHO STILL HAS HIS SCRUPLES INTACT. I WOULD LIKE TO READ HOW HIS LIFE BEGAN AGAIN.  I HAD A GREAT ATTORNEY WHO GAVE UP CORPORATE LAW FOR PRIVATE PRACTICE FOR THE SAME REASONS LISTED IN THIS BOOK. WELL DONE!","ACTION, SUSPENSE,  & MYSTERY. ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF THE LIFE IN LAW."
23,"This is a classic.  I have bought many copies in my work as a counselor and consultant.  The heart of it is what Covey calls the ""Maturity Continuum"" in which he puts ""Interdependence"" above ""Independence"".  The first three habits help people move from ""Dependence"" to ""Independence"", and the next three help people to move from ""Independence"" to ""Interdependence"".  Covey justifies putting ""Interdependence"" above ""Independence"" by pointing out that we live in an interdependent world -- we rely on others to provide goods and services.",A Classic that Supports Developing Health in Every Kind of Relationship
24,"This book is the second in a series of two.  I enjoyed this one so much that I have just ordered the first book and it sits in my Kindle now waiting for me to read it.
This book takes place 100 years after ""The Fall"" of civilization as we know it.  It is a murder mystery but for me the fun part was reading about the future civilization and how people lived.  Also the things that they had to give up and those things that they chose to keep.",Recommended highly but consider reading the first in the series before reading this one
25,"This is a really fantastic book that gives a lot of insight into how a master photographer thinks about photography... it's really interesting to hear his thoughts on each picture, why he likes it and what it was about the scene that made him take it.  Especially the description of what ""gesture"" means along with many examples is a great concept for photographers of all skill levels to ponder.

If you are looking for a gift for someone who loves photography, this would be a really good choice.",Great book for photographers or those that enjoy insights into photography
26,"l have read 25 of the books in the series now, and I am still enjoying them so much. The Amazon Quest kept me on my toes trying to figure out the James Parker character, empathizing with the Winslow family, tramping through the Amazon Rain Forest with the characters and once again being blessed by the faith and Christian walk seen in so many of the remarkable characters.  Thank you, Dr. Morris for giving us this outstanding series.  l will begin book 26 tomorrow!",The Amazon Quest was my latest favorite of the House of Winslow series.
27,"I was expecting more based upon the description and the other reviews I read.  Having traveled to China a number of times on business I found many of the ""insights"" offered by the narrator to be rather obvious, e.g. heavy pollution in Beijing.  As an avid tennis player, I enjoyed the portions that revolved around the tennis training, but those also seemed fairly superficial and truncated.

29,"Unique and entertaining way to teach math.  When I started to preview the first couple of books I highly questioned whether LOF would actually teach math, but by the time I had finished several books I realized how brilliant Stan Schmidt is in his approach.  As long as the kids do the activities suggested in the books and slow down to ensure they have memorized the math facts (addition and multiplication tables) and actually do the My Turn to Play sections before looking at the answers, as the author suggests, they will learn!",but by the time I had finished several books I realized how brilliant Stan Schmidt is in his approach

31,This Kodak publication measures up to the professional standards which are characteristic of most Kodak publications devoted to photography.  This is a concise in-depth technical overview of digital photography concepts pertaining not only to the equipment but also to the application of the nuances of photography in general to the new digital technology.

A book that deserves a prominent place in every photographer's library.,In depth overview for amateurs and professionals -- excellent!
32,"All of Jussi Adler Olsen's books are a good read. His characters are delightfully developed and diverse. The plots of each of the stories are well laid out and resolution is usually left till the last pages.

33,"One of the best series I've read in a long time. Kept me at the edge of my seat that I felt a bit upset when I found out I reached the end of the story.
I love all the characters, love the setting and love the ideas presented in the story. The events unfolding hold a lot of twists and turns keeping me want to know what happens next. And finally as a gamer, this presents my dream game/world coming true. I cannot wait to start reading the third book. This is brilliant. Highly recommend it.",Wait ... I reached the end?! No! - This is Brilliant. Highly recommend it!!
34,"This was a very good book.  The Main Characters were well developed and very mature.  They do not suffer from the silliness and one dimensional characterizations that often plague NA romance.  Lucy was adorable and Jensen was her perfect foil.  It is so refreshing to have a complete, believable, enjoyable story with a really good HEA.  No cliffhanger - thank goodness!!","Really good story, terrific characters, and no cliffhanger!!!"
35,"Excellent book! Not your typical ""Self-help"" book. Actually just the opposite.
Doesn't suggest someone go back and dig up all the junk from their past.

36,"What I love about this book is that, as in all of the best science fiction, the stories are a reflection or an illumination of how we humans think of ourselves on our planet in our galaxy in the universe. Until we actually meet up with other ""beings"" in our universe, we won't know how we will react. Clarke's mastery of prose maintains the mystery and allure of an unknown ""Planet"" created by unknown beings.

37,"A story EVERY child should read. I've read many biographies of George Washington Carver, but this is my all time favorite!

40,This is an epic adventure story that feels a bit like Grizzly Adams in The Lost World. The relationship between a typical mountain man uncle and his nerdy nephew is the focus of the story within a fantastical world. The author builds a colonial style world complete with its own legends and lore. Very well written and a must read for anyone who loves both Westerns and Fantasy.,This could be the first book of a new genre... Western-Fantasy..
41,"A brief warning to busy and smart people: the book contains some interesting insights and pieces of valuable advice. But, in the tradition of most self-help books, its worthwhile points could be communicated in a book 70 to 80 percent shorter. It is just unbelievably tedious with runaway background information and stories. It contains so much superfluous material that it is actually painful to listen to. And the good points get buried and forgotten in a flood of words. I normally prefer unabridged versions of books but this one begs for a most severe abridgement.",The book's good points get buried and forgotten in an epic flood of words
42,"I checked Blade Bound, book 13 of the ChicagoLand Vampires series, out from my local library. This was obviously a wrap-up book for a long-running series. Neill is a great writer with excellent characters, but there was so much of this book dedicated to the wedding, rather than action and drama, which is a hallmark of the ChicagoLand books.

 A very satisfying ending, and worth reading, although not my favorite book. There was a great teaser for a new book (probably a series) that I will look forward to reading when it comes out.","Blade Bound, lacks the usual tension, but wraps up loose ends"

She is descriptive and paints a great picture without so much detail that you get bogged down.  I think the writing is smart and very contemporary.  Once again, when I started a Besty Talbot book I was unable to put it down. These characters become people that you can really relate with and understand.

65,Much of the action and imagery is presented as perception with the lead character as an unreliable narrator given the subjective nature of his experience. There is also a large dollop of religious allegory which leaves me wondering why I got invested in Socket as a person. Unsatisfying in the same way as Spielberg's AI. A cosmic but personal journey that isn't fully either.,not a bad yarn but repetitive and strangely both over simplistic in theme and overly complex in plot
66,"I just finished this excellent little book and highly recommend it to any Christian in ministry. So, so good. Solid biblical truths to combat the lies we slip into believing about ourselves and our work. This would be a great book to read and then gift to someone you know in full-time church or mission work.","Wise, biblical counsel. Read this book early in your ministry career!"
67,"I'm debating whether to give it one or two stars.  It's very well written for its genre.  But it's not a complete book.  I know it's titled part 1, but I reasonably inferred that this was a trilogy of independent intertwined stories. Anyone who is at all invested in the story would be forced to buy the next book.  Part 2 may require purchase of book 3, then 4.  So offering book 1 free is no bargain; it's a manipulation.  This seems to be the trend now.  So my low rating is entirely a reflection of the publisher's manipulative tactics. I hope they're reading this.",Not a complete book.. Stops just where something pivotal is about to happen.

I often learn things as well. This book is no exception. You can totally enjoy this book without having read previous books, but they add richness to the other characters in the story.  There are some loose ends and suspenseful elements that are not tied up at the end of the book, but you still finish it feeling the ending was satisfactory.",... to her books and I have never yet been disappointed.

Excellent pacing; as facts were revealed and events unfolded, it had me guessing at which were the good guys vs the bad guys and changing my mind at least twice.

72,"This was a well-written, suspenseful and easy read that really gave the reader a sense of what it must have been like to have served in the Triangle of Death in Iraq. The only thing I didn't like was some of the characterizations of political leaders or civilians who did not support the war. Readers could have made their own opinion about the war without the political diatribes.","easy read, well-written, suspenseful - gave a good sense of what it must have been like to be there"

I think it is safe to say my hopes are that Ms. Hines would consider continuing to write about the Baron family and their journey.","Undeniably, an incredible ending to the series (hopefully for now)"
76,"This is my first book by this author and I really enjoyed her writing. So much so that I just downloaded the book Trust Your Vibes. At first I thought she might be going a little crazy explaining the many types of guides we all have, but while reading the book I actually called on a few she explained and it did seem to work.

I have been a Kelsey Cole fan for a long time ... but I actually don't recognize her style, characterizations, or plot lines in this really sad effort.  If I had a fireplace .. at least I could used it as kindling.  Bottom line ... if you are considering buying this book ... please don't waste your money.

I really hope this was an aberration ..  but I will closely read reviews of any more books in the IMAD series.",Don't buy if you are a Kelsey Cole fan.. your heart will be broken
80,"I'm learning so much from this book.  I've learned that the invisible hand, if there is one, isn't an equalizer -- contrary to what economists have theorized -- but is rather an imbalancer.  The diffusion of knowledge -- not capital investment -- is the most crucial mechanism to reducing income inequality.  People have been trying, and failing, to tax capital gains for more than 300 years!

85,I was supremely disappointed in the wrap-up. I found the defendant unlikable from the beginning but I figured that he was in an overwhelming personal crisis so his true nature would come out in the end; making us understand why his wife and family would sacrifice so much for him. I felt betrayed at the end.. everything fell apart so completely..  I also found it really tedious in parts.. wish I hadn't spent the time listening to this book (books on cd),Wish I had read the reviews first. Would've saved me the trouble of reading the book

I was up for another mystery and in spite of the fact that other reviewers liked it and said it was more character driven than her first book, I decided to try it.  My mistake!  I found it too boring.  I did buy one of another Cleeve series, however.  It IS a mystery and I have great hopes.....",Although I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in the Shetland series
134,"Have you ever read a book that has an event that is so horrible that you have to take a break - back up - even maybe cry with the loss. This 3rd book in the Red Rising series is the best of the 3.  Everyone thinks the Reaper is dead. Why wouldn't they - his execution was public. Nobody is looking for him as the Jackal keeps him locked in a box without light.

Lies and politics go hand in hand. Alliances are made along with tremendous sacrifices. Lives are lost, friendships rekindled, and the war of the colors and for freedom, continues.

I did get this book from my local library","Darrow is not a wolf, he does not ride dragons. He is the Reaper of Mars and he is coming"

Feeling antsy over her depictions of impossibly cruel or hopeless, masochistic characters. Books one and two got me hooked.

The editing left much to be desired - misspelled words and so many punctuation errors that it really took away from the story.  The use of commas was especially bad.

Not only that, but heros abound right alongside some serious brain twisters and the effects of plain old chance. About the Taxol example: Richards uses the cancer drug as an example for duplication to help the human race because it can only be created within the yew tree.

The novel was shortened by Sir Terry's illness and did not have the meat and bones or the humor his earlier novels had - understandable. Yet the story was important and did much to place the protagonist in the proper perspective and allowed fans to say goodbye to one of the other series' protagonist.

A little too heavy on the physical scenes, but there is so much more to the plot line.  Although I usually dislike sequels, M. Gabaldon handles it well.  Issues are resolved enough at the end of the book that you feel a that the novel ended, but there is enough going on that you want more.  I plan on re reading all 8 novels.

-- the basic idea (woman who has telepathic contact with animals) is cool;
-- Morrigan does a very nice job with the animal end of those communications;
-- Grace Wilde, the protagonist, is a well-constructed character, likable and imperfect and energetic.

Stolle walks you through an interesting period in French history beautifully due to good research.  Some of the phrasing is 21st Century but that is not worth dissing the book over.  The characters are rich and interesting.  The story covers about a one year period, thus leaving the book open for a sequel.  At times the plot is a little complex but that is due to the depth of the research.

If you haven't read the series, I'd start at the beginning. Yes, you can enjoy this novel without reading the previous ones, but there may be a surprise or two spoiled in the previous books.

Ashling is an Irish girl who lands a job on a start-up fashion magazine, and Lisa is a fashion editor sent from London to manage it who'd been expecting a promotion to New York.

I read the descriptions on the next book and it is a continuation with the handyman mystery and new stories of the new guests.  This book is a stand-alone story.

Took this book and tossed it too.",Just ruined a $30 piece of Salmon...save yourself a lot of pain and pass on this book.

199,"the story is entertaining enough but the bizarre fascination with alliteration and the constant misuse of loose vs lose became rather maddening. Good potential but needs a proper editor to clean up all the errors that slide by a spell check (costumer vs customer and so on).

Still, I did finish it which is more than I can say for many of this type of book.",I finished it but kept tripping over the errors an editor would have found
200,"It took me a while to read this book because I was afraid of its ending. I thought that I would be disappointed. I wasn't. I had tears when I finished the book.

I didn't appreciate the language, but I was glad most of the r-rated scenes were implied and not actually written out. I thought the premise of the story was interesting if not somewhat disturbing.

While this book provided some cursory tips, the bulk of the focus was on describing the author's research:  what particular areas of the brain lit up when various emotions were taking place.

By Angela",WoW! What a great story about not judging others immediately!!
218,I have had a long standing admiration of Phillpe Karl's writing and this book is a must read. Not always pretty but then as he says horses learn how do do things in different ways. 'Pretty' is not always correct anyway as he well illustrate with drawings (from photographs) of horses winning at the highest levels of dressage. The main trust is not to overload the back and forehand but to train the horse  to carry his own head and lighten the forehand. He uses jumping to give the horse other things to do.,A real discussion how modern methods have detrimental effects on the horse.
219,"I thought the way Hayton wrote the book was well done. It was a combination of flashbacks and present day.  I was kept guessing until the very end of the book, I didn't know what was real and what could have been hallunications.

The author drew me in with the stories of the guys (they're all men except for one) surfing giant -- 50' + -- waves. She moves the story along by alternating chapters among surfers, science and historical descriptions of great waves, both at sea and waves that come ashore.

I had only seen the movies. He had read the books. Thirty years later, I finally got around to it.
Raymond Chandler? He was a master. Of similes and limericks. Of sly observations. Of letting his story unfold as if it were not he who is writing it.

It is that she obviously has no ability to read people. Or protect her own interests. It was amusing at first, but became wearisome eventually, so I skimmed to find out what would happen. I don't believe I'll read another by this author. When a main character's credulity puts her in real danger, things aren't so funny.",Amusing but requires too much willing suspension of disbelief.

I have found this edition of Augustine's writings to be a little more opaque than some others, but it's definitely a college reading level and still fairly easy to pick up and read.

It can also be re-read over and over to stimulate the irrational centers of the brain and bring the reader into harmony with the clash of biology and society, family and individual conflicts.

It started out as a space opera.... but not your typical one... the space navy was not so well developed but were exploring space. Then it all twisted and it became a story about life... survival and beating the odd... and also love. Great risks... great losses but I won't tell you anymore.

Waiting for book two :)",A great read that quickly developed into a bigger storyline that I expected. A good story for an old sailor.
264,"Perhaps the best book available today, concerning the Israeli/Palestinian issue. Very easy to read, deeply engrossing and hard to put down, until you're finished. There are extensive end-notes, providing primary sources as well as further research for those so inclined. If one wants to begin learning about the crisis, this maybe you're best choice. If one wants to further enhance your knowledge, this is the book for you. If one is looking simply for a great book to read, this is the book for you. Thank you Max Blumenthal for a great book!","Perhaps the best book available today, concerning the Israeli/Palestinian conflict."
265,"A fast-paced read, fact based and logical.  As a Christian, I find the life and mission of Jesus personal, emotional, hopeful, and purposeful.  This book allowed me to look at Jesus' life from the historical viewpoint, based on facts that have been recorded throughout history in places other than the Bible.  It also enabled me to see Jesus not only as someone I believe is the Son of God, but as a human, vulnerable man, who in spite of his holiness, felt the love, frustration, and abandonment of those closest to him during his time of great need.",Historical and fact based--enables reader to see the humanity of Christ
266,"The recipes look good but most of them have a chicken or beef ""base"" (like boullion cubes) included in the ingredients as a flavor enhancer. I am allergic to brewers yeast or autolyzed yeast so can't use it in the recipes. I am not sure what the meals would taste like without the ""base"" inclusion  and if they would be flavorable enough.",Recipes include yeast product as a flavor enhancer which is OK if you're not allergic to yeast
267,It's really too bad that the author of this book ripped off a flow chart about mansplaining that was created by Elle Armageddon and then refused to comment on or answer any of the people who demanded it be credited and an apology to Elle be issued when they were posted on this book's facebook page. Profiting off another woman's work and not giving credit is the opposite of being a good feminist comrade and the author should be ashamed of themselves for doing this. I wouldn't buy this book for that reason alone.,Plagiarizing the work of other women is distinctly  un-feminist
268,"First book in the series that I've read. Though it's already the third installment, I've no difficulty grasping the story because it can stand on itself. Past stories were mentioned so you could comprehend why such a scene is happening. The book is action-packed, detailing the journey of Issac who left his town and is followed by bad guys seeking revenge for their kin's death. There is also violence (well, action-packed stories always have a violent side) but also shown Issac's love for family and friends. Looking forward to reading other books in this series.",detailing the journey of Issac who left his town and is followed by bad guys seeking revenge for their kin's death
269,"This book is my favorite of the Baby Professor series so far. This book even though it is 17 pages long it gives a great introduction to the most common of the ancient civilizations. It has amazing pictures and get information about each one. This is not an in depth look,it is more of  an overview of each.
This one I feel is for 3-5 grade and would be great to show kids and have them choose a civilization to explore more in depth. Think of it like an a menu and appetizer not a full meal of information.

I received this for free for my honest review",A great brief overview of these great civilizations for young children
270,"I thought this was beautifully written, Makes me want to go sit with her and have a cup of coffee and chew the fat about how things happened in her life and talk more about them. I feel bad about how James just dropped her like a dirty  napkin never to talk to her again, He needs to make peace before he leaves this earth,","Honest, heartfelt and beautiful look at one of my favorite artists"
271,"A lot of fun, as usual, and pleasantly creepy.  Without giving away too much, ""David Wong"" touches on the interesting question of whether a fake reality is really so bad (the answer in the Matrix was, of course, a resounding ""Yes, it would be bad."") in this book however..? (Ok, how DOES she stay standing?)

I would suggest reading at least the first book in the series, and then this one twice, just so things start to make sortof sense.","It's offical, I am now someone who awaits the arrival of the next David Wong book"
272,"I backed this set on Kickstarter. The profit from the sale of these goes to the upkeep and maintenance of Undershaw, Sir Conan Doyle's residence. Beyond the cause that inspired the sets publication I have to say that this is the best set of traditionally placed Sherlock Holmes stories that I have read. The stories are well written and there are a good number of twists and turns that I will leave to you to discover. This set is a very worthy addition to the Sherlock Holmes saga. Enjoy!!",The best set of traditionally set Sherlock Holmes stories that I have read and for a good cause to boot!!
273,"I purchased this book because my brother committed suicide, there were a few helpful tidbits and it did a good job explaining how someone who is depressed feels. However, I felt a large part of the book was devoted to how to ID someone who is suicidal, warning signs, etc. which is somewhat useless after the person has passed. It was very short and quick read. Overall, I think you can get a better book on this subject than this was.",there were a few helpful tidbits and it did a good job explaining how someone who is depressed feels
274,"I actually went to school with this guy, so I was personally interested in why he was there, and what the facts were in this case.  I was most impressed with his wife, Peaches, who moved Heaven and Earth to get a helicopter up to save Beck.  I was then impressed when he let someone else go first, not knowing if the helicopter would make it back to save him.  Great story.",A story of hope and survival on Mt. Everest by a dude who probably should have stayed home!
275,"A wonderful story with a unique plot. Once you start reading you won't want to put it down! They never have sex but it was very sensually descriptive, but after all they have done you know once they do it's going to be explosive! I can't wait to read the next one not only to read about the couple being together but to find out what happens next in the great plot!

I definitely recommend this book.",Will Parker and Grayson be able to navigate the storm coming their way and find their happily ever after
277,"This novel was not quite as heart pounding and tense as some of the previous stories, but it was classic Longmire nonetheless. The action was a bit slower and the mystery not so complex, but I still enjoyed the characters and the relationships between them just as much. I think the sub-plot with Cary and Michael should have been fleshed out more,  but perhaps Mr. Johnson is saving that for the next book. There's certainly enough there for a standalone story. This one gets 3.5 stars, and either way, I'm looking forward to the next one. #LongLiveLongmire","Not as edge-of-your-seat as previous stories, but enjoyable anyway."
278,You gotta love their determination. I'm shocked at their obvious tactic at hitting the non helpful button after SOOOO many Reacher books. I only found out about him 3 years ago and have read every single one since then. And I'm middle aged and have reading this stuff for 30 years. Of course it's unreal and gets a bit repetitive. Isn't that what we love about this guy? I can go toe to toe with any literary snob out here. It's mindless fluff and I love him to the nth degree. My internal clock says it took 2.5 minutes to write this review.,The NON helpful clickers are out in full force if you check it out carefully.
279,Found it difficult to keep track of all of the charcters.  Difficult to understand where and why the story line moved as it did.  Ok story but in truth there was not much to like about Benn Bluestone.  Almost had to force myself to continue to the end.  Too easy to put book down.  I prefer stories that drag me back and I hate to quit reading.  Probably would not select another book from this author.,Ok story but in truth there was not much to like about Benn Bluestone
280,"The author  writes a compelling story of an American soldier and his squad being 'displayed' in hero fashion to the American public at a Dallas Cowboys football game. This is powerfully written with excellent dialogue. Many emotions, conflicting and otherwise, on display here. I'm not sure whether the author served in the military but if not he certainly must have consulted with actual soldiers who'd been in battle to capture the thoughts of  Billy, the main character.",This is powerfully written with excellent dialogue. Many emotions
281,"I am always a big fan of flawed protagonists who set out on a quest to avenge the death of a loved one.  Bonus points if the protagonist is female.  Double bonus points if the story takes place in a historical setting and effectively used actual historical details.  This book checked all of those boxes.  With compulsively readable prose, great characters, and a gripping plot this was a solid piece.  I will definitely be recommending this to anyone who will listen.",Grieving teenage girls out for vengeance are kind of my thing.
282,"Really enjoyed this book, which follows the stories of three young women at various points in life.  The second part of the book takes a challenging turn, and creates a connection between the three women.  I was blown away by overarching story, and the three separate yet connected stories of the women (all heroines) in this book.  Empowering and eye opening for all who read it!",Blown away - great story with unexpected connections between characters

While I have not had the opportunity to read it fully, the thorough index made it easily useful for my needs, and I look forward to being able to read the rest of it at my leisure.",Excellent reference tool -- or pleasure read for a Shakespeare geek 
287,"I enjoyed the characters and the storyline was good. I was frustrated that she didn't resolve some of the issues that came up with the church elder and the fight in the church.

Otherwise, it was well written and I enjoyed reading it!","Good book, but would like to see some things resolved that were left hanging :)"

The lives of the individuals are beginning to be to drawn out,  I'd like to know how it ends for each one at this point and move on.

292,I would agree with many of the reviews that this is a fast paced complex novel that is well written.  The issues are complicated and Ling does an excellent job of showing different points of views.  I was very engaged until the end when it just stopped.  I have read many books that had an ending yet still left room for a sequel.  This only did the later.,The issues are complicated and Ling does an excellent job of showing different points of views
293,"I'm only into chapter 2 and I really like the way the book is laid out.  Good examples and clear explanations and proofs regarding what is going on.  I agree with other reviewers that you are going to want to take an introductory statistics class at a minimum, and preferably including some calculus-based probability.  But once you have that background, this book will help you get to the next level.

After watching an ""Ed and Jack"" lecture on YouTube, and having produced some video documentaries in the past, I found the book to be very informative for photographers and videographers.  The collective knowledge of the ""Lawyer and Photographer"" is worth every penny spent on this book.

In the legal area of copyright, a little knowledge is a VERY good thing!","Excellent, informative, and very practical digest of the murky world of copyright law."

310,"I was curious to find out the war experience of flying in a canvas biplane in WW2, so I picked this up. It was a very interesting read - Lamb participated in the Royal Navy attack on Taranto, operations in the Med, Greece, and he also offers some great insights into the experiments used to extend the range of the Swordfish.
The pleasant surprise for me was that Lamb was active in espionage activities in North Africa. His experiences with the Vichy French led me to learn more about Vichy France.

But, the pictures are quite small for toddlers and sometimes not very clear and some answers are open to interpretation.

I think you would have to be a doctor or medical student to enjoy and understand the book, neither of which I am.  Spent most of the book skimming and skipping whole pages just to finish.

I'm sure the author meant that it was going to be an uncomfortable read - which it was, but it had another meaning for me: I didn't enjoy it because it got boring.

If you like his other stuff, I recommend this one.",This is my second favorite Lethem novel (first is Motherless Brooklyn)
330,"This is a heartwarming story in which the main characters are faced with a host of life changing events.  We, as readers, travel with them through the ups and downs that come with decision making in times of upheaval.  We get to see how different individuals use their strengths to solve problems.  And we come to understand that ""disabled"" is not a very accurate label because it refers to only a narrow set of ""abilities"".",What will happen when a small town's animal shelter must close down?
331,"Anyone that likes football will enjoy reading this book. By the time you get to the end you will argue that Lombardi must be included in the list of greatest coaches of all time and possibly top the list. I was born in 1957, just prior to the time of this book, and it brought back memories of many players who were among the best at that time, both on the Packers and many other teams. I truly enjoyed the read and the many memories it brought back. Definitely recommended.",A very interesting treatise on perhaps the greatest turnaround in football
332,"Though several reviewers mentioned the need for editing, no one complained specifically about how the kindle version was laid out. I cannot imagine that the print version looked like this! Every single  paragraph had a different indentation; sentences stopped in the middle of a line after which there was dead space til the next line; and chapter designations had no spacing between them and the first paragraph.

334,"This was a beautifully written story of love and heartache. I don't usually go for these types of books, but the author drew me in with the first page. I couldn't stop reading, this was so engrossing. Mileva's story inspires women to aspire to reach their dreams, and not let a man (or anyone, really) stand in their way. I feel heartbroken and wistful, but happy I got to know the possible story of the woman behind Einstein. I highly recommend this book!",A must-read historical fiction book that will stay with you forever
335,"While I wished I had read the first book in the series, this one stands on its own with sufficient explanation of the backstory. A very well researched background on the civil war, its medical practices, and its heroes on both sides, or as we here in Texas sometimes call it, the War of Northern Aggression. The principle heroine is a woman of great character and courage, and the outcome of the romance is in question until the last moment.  Great writing. .",The principle heroine is a woman of great character and courage

You have everything from the Hidden Holocaust (abortion) to a major article on the Homosexual Menace (with pictures!) to the evils of women in the work place (in an article written in the 1980s, no less).

A friend raved about this series so I decided to step out of my comfort zone and give it a try and I liked it so much I downloaded the second book! It took a little bit to get use to this idea of aliens but after awhile you kinda stop seeing them as aliens, until tails and horns are mentioned! lol I thought the author was very imaginative with creating this other world and giving detail about the aliens and their way of life.

Pick this if you are looking for a steamy romance with some substance behind it.",This is an entertaining followup which can easily be read as a standalone
340,"I was giving this book to read by hidden Gems after reading this story,  it was a little hard to get into. The story was very interesting  and it gave you the insight of what Ruth and what her family life was like.

But it is obviously a used library copy, with a paperback binding, and lower picture and paper quality. Fine for my needs. But if you want a really nice one, go to at least the medium pricings.

343,"Very engrossing novel.  I enjoyed the time travel from the early days of this family in Afghanistan, to the present day.  It was very apropos to what is going on in the country.

Kept me interested in the book from beginning to end.",One of the most engrossing and valuabl books I have recently read.
344,"Great for using at home with kids up to elementary school.  I gave it as a gift and it was extremely useful.  Gives examples of what might be causing the feelings.

The definitions of big, medium and small feelings with discussion of how to keep reactions at a similar level has been a lifesaver for us.",Great idea for helping understand both feelings and reactions.
345,"The mightily muscled barbarian warrior Thoral seeks the Pudding of Power (and a few other baddies) with his faithful sidekick, Brad, the talking koi fish, and his noble steed Warlordhorse. It's a spoof of all fantasy clichs, with subtle and not so subtle references to standards like Terry Pratchett and Lord of the Rings. Wildly over-the-top, intentionally melodramatic and ridiculous, so don't make the mistake of taking it seriously.

I don't want to give away the ending or anything, but there was some stuff that needed to be added in there to complete the story.

You're certain to find something fun to write about.",This is going to be a great resource for my basic writing students
396,After reading this book I've come to the conclusion that there really wasn't much mentioned that wasn't in any other book about bubbles AND if you haven't read a book about stock market bubbles this is a great start. I've read several of these types of books over the years so I didn't find this book extremely useful but for people who are just beginning to get involved in the stock market this is a great book.,Not a lot of ground breaking info but a good book for beginning students of the markets
397,If you enjoyed the powder mage series you will certainly enjoy this next book with some of the same characters. This story introduces some new characters and as usual is a fast read. If you are new to the series I would recommend starting with the first book in the powder mage series but you can still enjoy the book without doing so. I strongly recommended this book and the powder mage series to all readers who enjoy the fantasy genre.,Sins of empire- must read if you enjoyed the powder mage series
398,"It's a light-hearted (mostly) mystery that provides some giggles and is very mainstream. Some people are pretty critical, but I enjoyed the book. It's a quick read and it could have used an editor's review. I agree with some other reviewer's comments that the ""pop quiz"" questions were novel, but they got old quick.  Some of the characters are stereotyped, but I enjoyed the humor and the self deprecation. I recommend it for a plane or beach or weekend read. It's like cheese popcorn; you wouldn't eat it for a meal, but it's a great snack.","Much better than other Kindle ""cheap"" mysteries -- funny and sweet"
399,"One of those rare cases where the book is so much easier to use than the Kindle version.

400,"This book deals with some interesting UFO/alien/unusual occurrences primarily outside of the United States. It illustrates the difficulties that sometimes occur when a person reports an alien contact. Timothy Good goes into detail about some of the strange creatures and cow mutilation. It is also a good reminder, that if you get any physical evidence, get as much you can. Then cache it like a squirrel does nuts, never giving all of it to any one person or organization. Too many people trustingly find that the proof they've given sometimes disappears.","Just because it would be nice not to have scary creatures exist, it doesn't mean they don't"
401,"The pocket guide itself has some great recommendations and history of the cities. It hasn't been updated in a while though so not all of the restaurants were still there. The seller didn't mention that the map which is supposed to be included was taken out so that was an annoying discovery.

405,"Sorry for the bluntness. I have enjoyed Kleypas in the past (someone to watch over me...the prequel to Lady Soph Lover)but boy did she get steamy in this one. I don't think there is one act of (normal) sex she didn't cover between these two hornballs. KUDOS to Kleypas on that one. Though the storyline was a little thin(I had Nick Gentry figured out first 100 pages). Who cares? Good, hot sex. I liked Ross from the first book (someone to watch over me) but felt the heroine could have had a stronger constitution. She was a little weak. Did I mention what great sex they had though?",What it lacks in storyline is made up for with SEX! Wow! HOT!

Can't imagine a pre-adult getting ahold of something like this.","Why would anyone write, much less read this kind of depraved, sadistic stuff?"
408,"This was an absolutely fabulous read. It starts with a very personal note from the author and then goes on to tell a story of incredible value to WWII history buffs -- one I'd never heard or even heard hinted at before. Sullivan does a deft job telling the tale of an Italian patriot put in a difficult position, and somehow succeeding at the job he was given, despite the many trials he faced. Italy has a new hero to celebrate.",Mr Sullivan has unearthed a wonderful tidbit from history and shared it in a most engaging way

414,"Not quite the story teller that Clive Clusler is but an ok read.  I personally didn't appreciate all the swearing nor the sexual explicate parts.  They didn't enhance the story, rather detracted from it.  The Clusler books don't include that Nd are better stories.  Like the adventure along with facts in lauded to make it believable.

415,"I so related to the stories in this book. Our culture does such a number on women and girls. Our energy goes to body shame, trying to be perfect, criticizing ourselves, obsessing, seeking magic.

470,"I'm writing this review as teh mother of a 4th grader. While the book is very moving and well written, I would hold off on introducing it until your child is at least in middle school. I felt the theme was pretty intense and traumatic for my sensitive and impressionable 9 year old. The story teaches a great moral concept...it enforces the concepts of friendship that crosses differences and social barriers, compassion, kindness, etc...I just felt it was a little bit harsh for my comfort level, given the age of my child.

""The Persian Puzzle"" is comprehensive but precise and tries to lay it down the middle.  However, since the author is at the center-left Brookings Institute, it tends to have a slight slant.

Unlike a lot of similar books that have come out since 1999, the authors have clearly visited all the locations in the book and have included original research and observations.

Even a bad finish is better than no finish.,This series does not seem that it will ever be finished.  Do not start!
490,Kind of dark story.  It discusses the religion of global warming.  Who would have guessed global warming is a theory turned religion.

I must read for any thinking person and quite an exciting story to boot.,Great fast paced story with lots of twists.  Lots of usefull information.
491,I really wanted to like this book and kept hoping it would get better.  But in truth I just did not like it.  Each of the characters are thinly drawn and unlikable.  The way the story jumps around 30 years in these three women's lives was sometimes hard to follow so I couldn't recall if that incident had happened yet.  It is hard to explain the time traveling but I think it hurt the story to have tiny morsels given to you throughout the book.  The ending was rushed and the bit with Kate at the end was just odd.

I recommend this book to readers of any age but especially to those 13 - 18.  Given it's subject matter of homosexual rape, the topic was handled respectfully. The focus more on the scars left behind and the healing that takes place as two people, broken by the event, seek to rebuild their lives.

I enjoyed this book as I have enjoyed many of Rose's books.  I especially like the background information as it relates to the Native American history contained within the story.  Truly and eye opener.",A story of 2 broken young men who find healing as they share their journey.
528,"Philip K. Dick shows his humor in this mainstream novel. This is basically about a practical joke gone wild. Dick is the author who brought you the stories that so many movies have been made from including Bladerunner. His science fiction is awesome, his mainstream less known and not as consistent, but worth checking out, some are very good, others not so, but this is a jewel.",Funny and worth reading for a lesser known work by a famous science fiction writer!
529,"Great resource on the modern ways business models can enhance your current operations. This includes the analysis of the customer, value proposition, value chain and profit mechanism.

This book reminded me of the Narnia books by CS Lewis and was easy to enjoy. It is well written with many likable characters. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the Chronicles of Narnia or likes a good fantasy story.",as he tries to escape a world of war in search of a better place. While running away from death
531,"Really enjoyed advice and new perspectives on the topic of, bottom line, how to deal with anyone who is passionate about their beliefs which are not yours. Great background on various religions, too. Can't imagine anyone who wouldn't benefit from a new perspective on their pet peeves, religion being one.","Can't go wrong here!  Can extrapolate to a much wider audience, too"
532,"This book is a great way for children(or even adults) to see how the game of baseball has changed through the years. Especially for a children's book, there is a good bit of information, while not going into the extreme detail that I'm sure could fill a MUCH larger book.

The illustrations are a mix between real photos and cartoons, and they are spread liberally throughout.

This is an excellent book for both baseball fans and collectors, and also those that are just learning about the sport.",Perfect for both baseball fans and those just learning about the sport.
533,"Being used to Kellerman's Alex Delaware novels, this one through me for a couple of chapters (I guess I expected Alex to show up and he didn't).  However, this is more of JK's great writing.  I loved the twists and intrigue.  The new character is well developed and I look forward to more stories about her.",this is more of JK's great writing. I loved the twists and intrigue
534,"This was a fun read with a perfect combination of action, romance and faith in a rich sci-fi setting. Thats a hard combination to achieve, but I think this author did a great job of it. If you love sci-fi romance, but don't want foul language or graphic sexual content, this is defiantly a book worth reading.","Perfect combination of action, romance and faith in a rich sci-fi setting"
535,"I bought this book thinking I would use it to get 'talking points' for a business English student whom I was coaching. To my surprise and delight, however, I am finding that the content and exercises contained in this book are helping me to dramatically improme my own 'believability' as a coach and private tutor as well.",One of the best 'self-help' books I have seen in a long time.
536,We found this book to be a wonderful way to celebrate 40 years of viewing for children.  Our family began watching Sesame Street when it first began in the late 60's.  It is wonderful that the programing is still around for the children to see today.  Now my grandson's are enjoying it like their fathers did 40 years ago.,sesame street:  A Celebration of 40 years of life on the street
537,"This is one of those books that sound good, but then you find how boring and unbelievable  his wife can be. Did she not know on one hand things were not going well, but she changed her mind quickly  Oh No, everything is lovely.  Yes this is a very disappointing book! Moves very very very  very  slowly. Did I mention it moved  SLOWLY!  To me I'm sorry I bought this one.","If you like books that take up alot of time to read the same idea over and over again , you will enjoy this one then!"
538,"This book had it all! Suspense, panty melting sex, happy times and then the full on sobbing while reading the story times. Doesn't hurt either that I'm thrilled to be in the secret club that is mentioned in the book...yes there is one, and I'm indeed a smuffin!!! Thank you EJ...what a lovely suprise!

539,"Well written, with both ""inside the brain of your terror-ier"" and ""how to know what s/he is going to do - and how to work together with your dog to form a wonderful relationship"" insight.

Pediatricians really are teachers who assure and comfort nervous parents IMO, and dog trainers are really training the pet parent to gently lead the pack. I don't know about human children, but this book is spot on when it comes to terrier children.",How to be a step or two ahead of your terrier and lead with a sense of adventure
540,"This book is the reason I passed the Security Plus (Sec +) exam on my first try. Gibson breaks it down into simple terms and it's an interesting read. This book WILL help you pass, as long as you read it thoroughly and are able to answer the review questions. I personally read 1 chapter per day so that i wasn't burned out.",I passed on my 1st attempt thanks to this Book. I Highly reccomend this book.
541,"I gave my original copy to one of my sons who became interested in the Barranca del Cobre (Copper Canyon) because of the book ""Born to Run"" McDonald. As a college student I visited there and first met the Tarahumaras or Raramuri as they call themselves, and the book by Lumholtz was a great revelation to me. I am an author myself and this book- I rate as a must read for a SW historian. By the way Caballo Blanco who is the main American character in the book ""Born to Run"" subsequently died in one of my favorite places in SW New Mexico by the Gila River.",Wonderful read on the Greater Southwest into the Sierra Madre of Mexico.
542,"The Fabulist takes you behind the scene into the wonderful world of reality tv. I would totally watch this game if it were on and I think that Dawn Chiletz should pitch it to a network.

543,"Comprehensive!  We got one book when we got married (Intended for Pleasure) and it's good.  BUT this one covers soooo many topics, especially ""how-to"" overcome particular situations, baggage, problems, etc.  Really, really appreciate it.  Learned about it from jessconnell.com and all of her amazing articles concerning sex inside marriage.",We got one book when we got married (Intended for Pleasure) and it's good. BUT this one covers soooo many topics
544,"It is so nice to read a story about a pretty confident woman of means, Georgiana, who goes after what she wants...her handsome land steward Henry Pye. Once again, the fairy tale woven into the main story was a nice touch. There were lots of brothers in this story for Harry and Georgina that added a lot of interesting twists. The supporting characters add so much to Hoyt's story. Great steamy scenes. We get to see some of the characters from the first book, The Raven Prince. My favorite of the trilogy is the Serpent Prince.",Position and money make a difference...especially for a woman.
545,A+++++++++ Read this second. I think I've had more corrective action given here and the ability to stop giving the ill person power here. I am always learning.  What a rescue ship these books were including the Al-Anon program.  If you are reading these then get to the Al-Anon fellowship for families of alcoholics. Al-Anon is about you repairing you as we have no control over the problem drinker. BE courageous and keep on keeping on in the program.,Essential read for families of alcoholics and the problem drinkers.
546,"I think everyone who is star struck over Hollywood should read this book!! My only criticism is that at times it was slow reading and dragged but I think that was due to the author striving to stay factual. Interesting point of how the police respected the movie directors and producers and let them have power over them. Hmmm, wonder if that still goes on today?????",Very good insight into Hollywood. The scenario still exists only much worse!!
547,Curse you Erin Watt and your cliffhangers. I have to wait until January now to see how this ends?!?!? Not acceptable!! Another amazing book in the Royal series and a killer cliffhanger and now I have to wait. There is only one word to describe what I am feeling right now - tortured. Love Easton! Loved him in all of the books and now learning all of these new things about him has thrown me into an emotional tailspin. I think I need a nap.,Cliffhanger alert!! Great book but be prepared for a cliffhanger ending!!
548,"I bought it to start my adoptive children in the routine of doing school while in country and to start working a little on their English vocabulary skills. My ASD son worked on the first grade book and liked it very much, we purchased the second grade book to take with us in the trip to keep up with school work. It is not a full curriculum but covers the all the bases and makes for a good practice resource. It is a thick book but easier to take than all the homeschool resources we use.",My ASD son worked on the first grade book and liked it very much
549,"Suspense, romance, great story line. I could not wait for this book and I certainly was not disappointed!  I could not put the book down.  Terrific story!  I have many of Colleen Coble's book.  She is one of my favorite authors and I have enjoyed every book I have read of hers.  You will not put the book down!",Can't wait for the next book in this series.  An absolutely terrific book!
550,"Pretty tough to keep interest going.  I'm not sure why it didn't catch and maintain my attention.  I tried, hard, several times to get rolling with the book, and finally set it aside to pick up on the deserted island when I get sent there.

I initially bought this based on reviews and my interest in this subject, so it should have been a slam dunk.  But it doesn't mesh with my needs.",Sometime is really lacking in the flow and ability of the author to keep my attention
551,"Short, trite, sentimental, humorless, and just plain silly. I want to make a shaggy dog story pun here, but it's too much of a cheap shot.

There's not a believable page in this book. It's the sort of thing that a second-rate creative writing student might have come up with, but since it's by a NAME author it will sell 50gazzilion copies. I enjoy Elvis and Joe, but this one is trash. Save your money. Save your time.

Of course, if you adore doggy style, it may be your thing.","Fine if you like Rin Tin Tin, but Elvis Cole and Joe Pike it's not."
552,"I think that this series is delightfully entertaining, combining definite sexiness with lighthearted humor. Both the characters and the stories are engaging. I expect that Vol. 6 will be available in English in December and I definitely look forward to the opportunity to enjoy additional installments featuring the good-hearted Sena clan.",Proves that yaoi and wholesome family values can go hand in hand
553,"I started out with this title through a eBook special...quickly decided that I needed the paper copy! If you are interested in the history of Manhattan, yesterday and today, this little treasure is a must!

554,"When a wonderful local bead store moved and then closed entirely, I moved on from my love of peyote beading.  Kumihimo revived the interest in beading and then Amazon let me know about this book.  It has to be the best and most unusual book on Peyote beading in my rather extensive library.  I just can't wait to try the next thing.  My circular beaded bracelets have been getting lots of attention and directions are so good!",When a wonderful local bead store moved and then closed entirely
555,"This book describes how naive the United States' administrators and military have been all along after 9/11, presuming
Osama Bin Laden had been hiding in Afghanistan and Iraq, while all the time he was being shielded by Pakistani Army and protected in their Country. Instead of tackling the real enemy Pakistan, the powers that were in the United States chose to wage unnecessary and costly wars against a primitive Afghanistan and oil rich Iraq",Describes how the United States has been ignorant of Pakistan's duplicity all the time
556,"Whitehead's novel is spell-binding. His narrative of African slaves and the mind-boggling cruelty and injustices they had to endure is a harsh reminder of what humans are capable of doing to other humans. In a nation still sharply divided by race, Whitehead's Underground Railroad reminds us that we are not that many generations removed from one of the most reprehensible chapters of our history. If we are ever to truly eradicate racism we have to first understand what truly transpired. Whitehead's work earned a Pulitzer and National Book Award for good reason. Painful, yet enlightening.",Whitehead provides an artful glimpse into the horrors of slavery
557,"I found this book to be enthralling.  I felt a kinship to the hero who had low self-esteem resulting from a terrible beginning in life.  He felt worthless and spent so much time seeking acceptance that he didn't really need, except in his own mind.  These emotions led him into sticky situations with an ultimately good ending.  Well worth the read.",Good storyline about a troubled young boy coming of age and trying to give purpose to his life.
558,"Frankly I didn't know what I was getting into when I picked up this book. But Im glad I stuck with it followed it to its end. Not ever experiencing directly the challenges Sam faces, its not easy to relate. But I know of people who have struggled with similar issues and for that reason alone the story was well worth reading.","A well written tale, a difficult journey, a hopeful conclusion"
559,"Excellent, easy, actionable. I started a blog to document my results with a brand new twitter account running a #TwitterExperiment following tips from this book.

I would argue that many of the solutions rest upon a normative basis, rather than an empirical foundation. This makes some of these suggestions very speculative. Still, a very thought provoking book. Get it and learn.",Great ideas about how to change society through effective solutions.
562,"This is an enjoyable book!  The story follows a family through war, peace, love and marriage. While the characters are well defined and we grow concerned about their fates, we see the world they are living in at the time. The book is rich in historical events. I learned a lot about life as seen through the eyes of the English during World War I and II. There are abundant events in the military, on the farm, politically and socially that were so very well written, ending with a very surprising finale. I highly recommend it.","This is well-written based on fact, brimming with history and an excellent storyline."
563,"This became one of my all time favorite novels. Absolutely could not put it down. The humor was as original as were the endearing characters and unexpected storyline. I marvel at the imagination Miss Harmon has. I have read romance novels since 1972, this one gave me everything I look for in a novel.  Her knowledge of pirates and ships of that era were both enlightening as well as entertaining. Don""t miss this one! I have now read all of Danelle Harmon's novels and would highly recommend any one of them.",This became one of my all time favorite novels. Absolutely could not put it down
564,"An easy read, but it is more for those individuals who have a background in insurancel. Since I have both an intreest professionally and personally in the field,  it is a well written publication.  It is purely made for those with a limited  background or those new to the insurance industry.  I would say it is one of the best basic introductory to insurancce books I have ever read.",An excellent book to read for those with a limited knowledge of how insurance works.
565,"This book was a lot of fun, it had romance and 2 mysteries to be solved with a helping of steamy sex scenes. I like both of the leads and the story took place in an interesting back drop, goats, bees and sexy underwear with some chickens thrown in for good measure. I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it for everyone who likes romance with adult situations (they are not just holding hands and kissing each other on the cheek in this one). Take a visit to Sinful Montana, you will not be disappointed","Rugged special forces hero with an accent and a heroine who can hold her own, what's not to love"

Hilaria's characters had so much personality you couldn't help but love all of them. I was able to picture the way she described the events and locations throughout the story perfectly in my head. This has been my favorite book by Hilaria so far, the cast, crew, storyline, EVERYTHING about it was amazing. I highly recommend you scoop this baby up!",5 stars for Lost in Scotland. Take a chance and get lost in this book <3
567,"This is perfect for someone just starting out with Zentangling.  I almost didn't buy it because of some of the reviews I read.  I do not know why people who are experienced or semi-experienced tanglers expect this book to be more than basic, since it is called Zentangle Basics.  If you are wanting to dip you foot into tangling, this is a great little book to start out with.","If you are wanting to dip you foot into tangling, this is a great little book to start out with."
568,"To write a mystery revolving around the world of detox--and Ms. Zelvin knows her subject!--takes amazing chutzpah! But Zelvin has chutzpah to spare! Deft writing moves the story through the grim world, and wit softens some of the pain. But this introduction to a truly unique series is great. Ms. Zelvin is a writer to watch.","Forget any disinterest you might have for detox, this is good."
569,An strong sophomore effort from an emerging self-published author. The Tiger further integrates many of the threads present the the initial volume while also expanding the scope of the story and breadth of the world. The fantasy elements present in Stiger's Tigers receive greater depth and additional time while the familiar aspects of historical legionary life remain a constant focus and anchor to the the story line. Highly recommended for lovers of fantasy with strong historical and military overtones as well as others with interest in roman legionary life.,Builds upon Stiger's Tiger while opening up new plot lines and aspects.
570,"If Mr. Thomas' characterization of Eisenhower is accurate we Americans, and indeed the world, have much to appreciate about the man we most associate with D-Day and golf courses.  It's a fascinating biography of a complex man ""gaming"" those around him (a la Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals"") while engaged in the nuclear brinksmanship that those of my generation unknowingly relied upon in our duck and cover childhood.

Well written and paced as both insightful biography and modern geopolitical history.",He wasn't the Ike that simple treatments of the '50s would have us believe
571,"This high-contrast book doesn't just contain images, but a little story about a group of animals overjoyed about the new baby. It doesn't rhyme, but the repetition of the question and answer format gives it a pleasant sing-song. My little one loves to be mobile and it's difficult to get her to sit still for reading time. This is one of the very few books that can hold her attention. I'm really glad we found it.",but a little story about a group of animals overjoyed about the new baby
572,"I certainly did not like this book as much as most people seemed to. I tried to like it. The character of Rachel was too despicable for me to care about. The book was slow and repetitive. It told instead of showed, which I found annoying and boring. The last twenty percent kicked in and sped things up. I enjoyed the end.

574,"I read this in a few hours, virtually non-stop. I thought it was fascinating, and a very easy read. I only wish it had been longer, perhaps with more from the investigator side of it. The book is largely written from Mary's POV and also from her long term partner.  I would now love to hear this same story from an ""investigative"" viewpoint.  Still, I loved all the historical detail about life then, and the events that lead up to Mary's dual incarcerations. The author captured well her lack of understanding about the cause and effect of her actions.","very readable, fascinating detail of Typhoid Mary from a fictionalized novelization"

576,"Fascinating book from the German prospective of WWII in the final weeks of the war. It was a captivating book that I could not put down. It is a first person account of Panther tank commander Wolfgang Faust's fight to breakout of the Russian encirclement around Berlin and surrender himself, crew, and others to the American forces.

Meanwhile he gets mixed up in organized crime and becomes a getaway driver. If this plot-line sounds ridiculous, that's because it is!

Do not go in to this story expecting the movie version. While they did a respectable job for the most part, there is no interactions with Count Dracula - expect his execution.

The mixed emotions engendered are like those of one watching THE LOVED ONE for the first time. Sick humor. It gets you in the discomfort zone, where sham religion meets an industry based on formaldehyde and flowers. At its best, there's a whimsical black humor; at it's worst, it's like the obsessive train-wreck watching and ghoulishness found in HOLLYWOOD BABYLON.
I plan to take a tour. This book will rest alongside THE GHOUL'S GUIDE TO LOS ANGELES.","Good macabre fun for the discerning... go slumming, vicariously!"

He can't crank them out fast enough to satisfy my appetite.  Of course, that is why his works are of such quality, they are not cook-book.  Most of his works are intertwined with previous stories, in other words progressions.  So if you are looking for a first time Dale Brown work, I would suggest going back to the beginning with ""Flight of the Old Dog"" and build from there.",Dale Brown knocks another one out of the park in his ever-continuing series of techno-thrillers.

Her definition of love is slightly different from mine to say the least.  Her lovers are many and short lived.  She does not look for integrity or good character in her many romantic episodes just a quick fix.

675,"This may be the only Dickens novel I can stand, probably because it would be difficult to render the French Revolution boring or preachy. The story, full of the lucky coincidences and chances for redemption that make it a Dickens novel, is rather unbelievable, making it more of an allegory than a true tale of human characters. However the backdrop of revolutionary France is fascinating.

You can not easily use this one if you are part of a group study on the Chronological events. This one appears so far to be in the same order as my other, non Chronological Bibles. All Chronological Bibles I have ever seen have Job early in parts of Genesis. Not this one! Also, this has little study material though it is called a study Bible.

677,"This may be one of the most perfect, compelling, engrossing novels I have ever read. Kate Atkinson proves herself to be a master of character development, as well as a master of imagination. Each of the scenarios posited for Ursula's life are so engrossing and satisfying in their own right, and yet, throughout the novel there is a sense of foreboding and suspense because you know that soon you will be shown an alternate fate which may or may not be a safer, kinder life for the protagonist.

Even with all the frustrating editorial decisions the author took with her first book, In the Woods, her writing was excellent.

What I Thought About It
Well you have to accept a really, really, really big premise; but after that it is a great book throughout. The writing was engrossing again, not as many open plot points at the end (but there are some still there), and the characters are still likable. I will definitely be reading book three when it is released later this year.",I will definitely be reading book three when it is released later this year.
727,"I love this book, wholeheartedly.  I believe everything the author says about rape culture and Native American women.
I cannot repudiate the book or the author.
I lived among Alaska Natives for 25 years. That does not mean I knew them or understood them. I saw the rape culture - not that much different from the world  I grew up in. I am grateful for their courtesy and hospitality and especially their teasing.

At this point, I'm just finishing the series because I want to know how it ends.",Hmmmm....I'm sort of just hanging in there to get some closure on what Rama is all about.

An added bonus was that many of the supporting characters in the book, specifically Williams, had their own backstories and motivation outlined more clearly. All of this adds up to my eager anticipation of her next book.",Classic detective duo is the latest in an engaging British mystery series.

736,I was intrigued by the Author's ability to go back and forth between Laila's life before and after she arrived in America. I truly felt for her and her brother to have to be born into their lives in which they have no choice. The dynamics between Laila and all of her relationships was the best part of the book for me.

Seri is an amazing heroine and I adored Koro. I was a bit disappointed in Garreths brother. In the first book he was  such a great guy but here he was more like the villain until he redeems himself towards the end.

It was  a quick fast read.  It was the typical first meet up antagonism between hero and heroine. Hero helps heroine get over panic attacks.  Heroine helps hero finding his sister's one night stand. Hero and heroine have revelations about each other, great sex, and then happy ending.  Nice, not great.

I did, in fact, stop reading it for three days.  But the characters and their predicaments kept calling me back.

I am much more interested in the German, Austrian, Russian, Italian and French weapons of the period, so was somewhat disappointed with the relative lack of coverage of these.

The way he switched POV from one character to another was interesting, but off putting at times, jumping from one head into another.
It was rich and the characters were very well realized. I didn't like any of them, which isn't a problem for me as I enjoy flawed characters.

Echoes of Gone with the Wind made it seem less original than I'd hoped.  And, although the heroine is a well-developed character, the slaves and those in the privileged class of slave owners often seemed one-dimensional.  History happens at a distance.

I will admit that the first third of the book is sometime a bit to slow for other to read, but the character development kept me captivated. The strange idea of having two entities in a single body was captivating.  Appalling at times, heart-wrenching at others, the story is one that will forever stay in my heart.

It is a moving, humorous, honest story about a man who has to suddenly take care of his young nephew, and how they eventually become a family, along with the man's long-time boyfriend. Unique, realistic, funny, emotional, very well-written. Great sense of place (set in a small town in the South).

I have never known the drug culture but I feel like I understand it some now.  I am so thankful now for the ""regular"" childhood I had with average parents who didn't have a lot of money but surrounded us with love and guided us on commonsense as to what is right and wrong i.e. smoking pot, injecting with drugs = not good for your body.",Reading this is like looking at the carnage of a train wreck - you don't want to but you can't help but to stare.

I appreciate the fact that the story is told with quite a bit of humor and a bit of sexual inuendo without going into explicit detail, and the story is told well.  The characters are well rounded and you begin to know them very quickly and I was able to identify with almost every major character as there are people in my life that compare to a few of them.

Litore either has intimate knowledge of the ancient religion or has researched it thoroughly.  He takes a book out of the Bible and shares it with us in a completely different way.

Highly recommended.",Very well written documentary that weaves together several lives around the Chicago exposition
855,"This is an intensely emotional and wonderfully erotic dark series that will be sure to please fans of Elizabeth Hoyt like me. The romances were a little lacking compared to her later works (more physical than emotional, which is fine, but the emotions evoked in the Maiden Lane series makes it superior IMO) but great reads overall with stories i completely lost myself in",Heartfelt and dark historical romance series - Highly recommend for fans of Elizabeth Hoyt
856,Interesting book that can help us imagine that the the state of world without wars is not a permanent state and that our everyday's lifes can change in a minute due to circumstances we have no power to affect.

857,"Divine Scream by Benjamin Kane Ethridge, was received direct from the publisher in exchange for this review.  Like some other reviewers, I went into this novel expecting wonderful things from a Bram Stoker Award winner.  The novel started out good and then got kind of slow/boring/lost me and I found myself skimming through it.  While it was not a smart man book that seems to be the craze nowadays, I would only recommend it to those who read this author (this is my first by him), I am afraid if you do not love this style of novel, this book would turn you off of his style.","I am afraid if you do not love this style of novel, this book would turn you off of this authors style."
858,"When it comes to science and its limits, it's impossible to beat this book. That last statement is known to be true. John Barrows is an intense critical thinker, and the depth at which he can delve into the guts of existence, and their limits, frankly makes me envious. Impossibility is an extremely thought-provoking journey, and one I highly recommend.",Never have the themes of science and limitation been picked apart and interwoven so thoroughly.
859,"A wealth of detail on the leadup to the battle of Gettysburg, and of course the battle itself and its aftermath, and its effects on the civilian life of the town.  Also provides very good detail on the equipment in use in both armies, and other logistical essentials.  The numerous maps still leave something to be desired (it's a pain to be flipping pages to picture exactly where an event occurred and in what relation to other units and topography), but the writing is a joy to read and generates energy in the reader rather than draining it.","History of the Gettysburg battle, education with exhilaration all at once."
860,"The story is a great idea, but you have the same consuming problem of so many writers making the bad guys very capable and the good guys can't do squat. Here is this kid who is supposed to do miraculous things and he does't do anything to make this possible. Where is there any evidence that Wil  has any poweres? He has been kidnapped and nearly killed making everyone around him  look like buffoons.",You need fewer negatives and far more positives. Too bogged down.

Ruby and Rebel just scream a sensuous, pulse pounding LOVE/HATE relationship. I fell in love with these characters as I did the first two books in this series. The secondary characters as usual turn out to be major characters also. An intricale part of the story.  A.W.W. makes you crave more and more of her stories.

866,What a breath of fresh air!  John Leonard presents sharing your faith in a whole new way.  He definitely forces you to reconsider all you have been taught about sharing the faith.

My son and I fell in love with the first two books, regularly changing the ""story"" every evening to add details that we didn't notice in prior readings.

872,"I started this book hoping it would be as good as the description and reviews said it would be, and it was!  It seemed to be a realistic portrayal of China and the persecution of Christians.

I will be reading more by him.","I rarely write reviews, but this book was too good not to write one."
873,"In the Shadows of the American Century is the best book I have read this year. Alfred McCoy states his case and fully documents it. As many Americans, I was unaware that our country was striving for Empire. But it is sad to read that the American Empire, after only one century, is headed for the dustbin of history. It is even sadder to see that the Trump presidency is rushing our country there sooner than we would have ever thought possible.",In the Shadows of the American Century is the best book I have read this year
874,Definitely not for beginners.  JavaScript and its frameworks have a steep learning curve.  I highly recommend that this book be read by people who have experience in an object-oriented language and some JavaScript object-oriented and event-handling programming experience.  This book explains how JavaScript the language works and presents common problems and the design patterns to deal with the problem.  I had only wished this book had been written before I had started working with backbone.js a couple years ago.,Must read JavaScript book for experienced developers trying to master the mysterious JavaScript language
875,This is a really fantastic read; very well written; very good characterization; excellent plot; and a good mystery you probably will not solve.  This story twists and turns and comes around again and you wonder how the author kept up the pace.  A true spy/mystery.  I look forward to the continuation of the series.,"If you DON'T read this novel, you will surely miss good entertainment."
876,"I am a person who likes to know what really happened during historic events, particularly ones that are the subject of so much Hollywood and other media hype.  This account by Beasley, a survivor, is well written and probably provided much of the foundation for subsequent films and chronicles of the event.

This book helps us understand the financial madness many of us create for ourselves, and then gives us new ways of looking at it. To use the language of the book 'get out of the financial prisons we have created'.",Refreshing look at how to get out of the financial mess we often create for ouselves
879,Very good story. Well written. I was angered by the way women are treated in Saudi Arabia.

After coming across this little gem, a fun idea has turned into a work in progress. The confidence and motivation that comes with this knowledge is just as valuable as the information on the pages.

883,"The hardest part about reading Cormac McCarthy is that the way he writes you don't always know who is speaking until you reread the paragraph. As for the book, the descriptions make you feel like you are there and can see all. Graphic violence and it is described in detail. If you have a problem with that, you may want to steer clear. But he doesn't glorify it or use it too much.","Good read, but graphic violence. Warning for those that are sensitive to that."
884,"There's definitely a biblical sort of power to the passages in this book, both in the words and in the illustrations. The language is marvelous, but there's definitely a certain unsettled feeling while reading...the same sort of thing I got when reading the parts of the bible just after god got mad.

Not only that, but she lists (side by side) what products your hair care products should/should not contain. I particularly find this helpful because I have a problem using products with ingredients that I don't even know how to pronounce.

888,"Sometimes I was afraid the book would head into the abyss of 'paranormal'. But the author always avoided this slippery slope. The book jumps a bit in time. It's done by chapter. Therefore by no means puzzling.

889,"Beginning from the middle of the story,  Makos transports us back to one side of the incredible event, then sends us back to the others' point of view. A fabulous walk through the air war of World War II. From how these two aviators were raised and got into flying through their emotional ""reunion"" well after WWII's end, the reader will be kept on a high interest level.",You couldn't fake the authenticity of this incredible event and its outcome.
890,"On the positive side, I thought there were many beautifully worded phrases that really struck me.  I highlighted them and will refer to them when our book club discusses this book.  I liked the way it was narrated by two characters and I learned many things about the time.

My negatives, and they are slight,  are that I found some aspects of Hetty and her mom a bit unbelievable and I also thought there was some things thrown into the book that stuck out sorely (for example - when Paul Revere's craft shop was mention - it seems just thrown in and not necessary).

I would recommend the book.",Although it was a good read - I didn't think it was as good as all the hype about it
891,This book was slow and weak compared to other Elvis Cole books which made it simply average.  The author may wish to re-evaluate his motivation and discipline in writing what was once an exceptional story line.  I have been a long time Cole/Like fan but this story was a bit more average than expected.,This book was a shadow of the previous Elvis Cole books.  Read for continuity.
892,"Not my kind of book but I read it anyway. Good hearted older woman, has been beauty queen, not very successful real-estate lady decides that her life is no longer worth living. The story than goes on and on about her current not very interesting life and her past and all her mistakes. The secondary characters are more interesting than the protagonist. The book has a happy ending. I don't like these kind of  female characters who are fragile and weak and need a man in their lives to save them and make them whole and such...enough said.",That is what the main character does...dream about a guy she used to know in her youth

And it was a long one, which makes it all the better. It was easily equivalent to 3 books from other authors. The author has spent an incredible amount of energy in writing this book and it shows. I know that I will be reading his books as long as he writes.

There were many places in this book that really wrenched my heart and I do not pretend to be a softy. All good and I cannot wait for the next in the series.

896,The author's Naval background gives him a great base in strategy but also gives him tunnel vision when it comes to weapons and equipment that might be aboard a starship. Starships are very weight sensitive for example so its generally not a good idea to carry around a lot of heavy things like cannon balls or grapeshot. This is why they mainly stick to energy weapons in other sci-fi series. He never talks about the types of drives used except where it comes to their strategic capabilities.

At the beginning of this novel, I wasn't sure how she was going to be able to turn the love story around. Blake seemed like a womanizing pig. Danica seemed to be overly stuffy and judgmental.

There were some places the outcome of problems was predictable but other parts of the story had me completely drawn in because the outcome could have gone in any direction.

921,"Twenty-six Seconds sheds light on the impact on the Abe Zapruder family and descendants following his almost accidental filming of the shooting of President John Kennedy on November 22, 1963.  We have all seen that film clip over and over on tv and print for the last fifty five years. ABe Zapruder suffered from PTSD after viewing the bloody tragedy.  Questions arose as to who owned the film, media, government or the Zapruders. It is a worthwhile read, especially for those of us who are old enough to have been shocked by JFK's death that day.",Biography/History of the Zapruder Family's Famous Film of JFK's Shooting
922,"Goat Girl really has the footloose and fancy free crew of the motorhome twisted on this adventure. A missing friend traveling with dubious companion have gone missing! Bob is cooling his paws as usual,soaking up attention when offered(sometimes getting all of it)

923,"Not only because it's a half hour read. This book is great because it seems almost impossible that after more than 2,000 years, the text is still actual and current. Not only did Cicero (the author's brother) won the election he was after, he became one of the most famous political figures in ancient Rome.

The book, which is really a letter of 58 points that Quintus writes to his brother before his electoral campaign, is written in such a pragmatic and direct way, that the only way to describe it today would be ""politically incorrect"". Irony.","Not the only book you need, but should be the first on your list"
924,"Fade Into Me is one of the books that I want to watch it in a movie theater. I love the imagination of the author by creating these characters in two different world. Although it's a fantasy reading, I can see that the author tried to make it realistic. The conversations between the two main characters are well-built. I was sucked into the emotion of Caedan when trying to convince himself that Ryanne is the one. Playing with readers' emotion is one of the key factors of a successful book.",Playing with readers' emotion is one of the key factors of a successful book
925,This is one of the hottest books that is a must for economists.  It is creating a great controversy in the finance world.  The author takes a two hundred year history of the world's financial flow and reveals key political influences that created wars and various factors to influence the economy and stock market.  The author did not create an opinion of these facts but merely points out the history in a sequence of events and timelines as well as using financial graphs and formulas to show the facts.,"Facts, not Fiction, and very Important with Eyes Open on the world history of economics"
926,"I enjoyed so many aspects in this mystery. A wacky heroine with tried and true friendships. Two dogs that have their owners mostly trained. A hero that tries to keep his wife toning down her emotional responses to what's happening. Instead of a honey do list, they do notes to each other letting that spouse know what not to do. Humor to lighten the mood. A mystery you have to put pieces together to get the right suspect with the help of the dogs. You will find additional things you will enjoy when you read this mystery.
Theila",Another good mystery by Susan santangelo. Well worth keeping to re-read later.
927,"Walt & Sage have done a wonderful job of creating an interesting world and characters. It's definitely not for the light romance reader as a reverse harem story, so if you're used to that and Walt's other works, this may be a little steamy for you. For the price, it's worth checking out if you like either author's works. I was lucky enough to receive an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  Though it pushed my boundaries a little, I enjoyed the book as much as the first book and read it quickly.  Fairly well edited for an ebook which is refreshing, and a fun read!",Walt & Sage have done a wonderful job of creating an interesting world and characters
928,Excellent read and I enjoyed the entire series for your love. If you are a dedicated romance reader you will enjoy this book along with  the other two books that follow.

(Warning this is a M/M romance)  Dom goes to Lando for rehab after being shot and falling from a roof.  Love/lust at first sight becomes a dance of denial and obsession.  Lando wants to run, but Dom  loves the chase.  Like real life, problems keep coming up. Leveled is a wonderful, enjoyable bridge between The Marked Men and the Saints of Denver.  Thankfully all of the characters are interacting so every book is a family reunion that ends well.",Don't miss out on a beautiful crossover uniting Lando from Marked Men with the Dom from Saints of Denver.
930,I'll start by saying that this is book two of this series. I recommend you read the first book to fully enjoy and understand this book. This book is all about the damage and revenge. It has a twisted storyline and throws some curves at you as well. It has an ending you won't see coming and I recommend it to all the horror book fans out there.,A game of revenge where your worst fears are used against you. Loved it!!

I am happy to have found another series that gets her excited about reading.  There is also a Magic Kitten, Magic Puppy, and Magic Pony, so she should be busy reading for a while!

937,I've had this book sitting in my Kindle for a while now and I'm asking myself why I waited so long to read it. I've been in a book funk lately reading what I felt were just mediocre books until I read Six of Hearts. It kept throwing curve balls every time I think I've uncovered the mystery. Jay and Matilda definitely have chemistry together. Jay's illusions added to the story and it was interesting learning how one trick in particular was done.

But here Pollan is getting his hands dirty and really delving into what food is really about in our culture.  in the course of it, i learned some valuable insights that made me a better cook, not just about the food, but how it is delivered and enjoyed.

941,"My book club had one of the best discussions we ever had about this book.  It seems like a dark topic - autism - but the way it is written is intriguing and absorbing.

People who do not believe in God just don't have that knowledge that God exists, (or they deny what is in front of them). Sure organized religions are not perfect, but God is perfect and He loves his people, even Hitchens.

944,"A Passionate Love Affair reminds me of a cross between Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. Outrageously funny and simply outrageous. Ms. Robinson doesn't mince words and sometimes of course you have to guess at the meaning since the reader is advised that this novel is written in British English, and of course it helps to know some European customs to understand why the heroine calls someone a sausage. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it. reviewed by Heide Katros, Winter Haven News, Florida",A Passionate Love Affair with a Total Stranger by Lucy Robinson

Johnston's writing is taut, gripping, and beautiful, and Hermione is such a wonderful character--honest, strong, vulnerable, grieving, and utterly, palpably real. And I wish that every survivor out there had a friend like Polly. Just wonderful.","and beautiful, and Hermione is such a wonderful character--honest"

947,"I think this one out of the whole series is my favourite. Big call because I've loved this whole series. It starts with the prologue and seriously this is one of the best that I have ever read. It pulled at my heart strings and left me gasping for more. The whole book had Kat's trademark humour and quick, witty comebacks. All your favourites make an appearance of course.

949,"Apart from being shallow...the book is really disturbing in terms of its premise. (Flying city sucking up life and leaving hordes of undead in its wake) I know that's a matter of taste, and there are plenty of things in TES that are disturbing... but this leaves a particularly disturbing aftertaste, and memorably so. In any case... wasn't the flying city already done by Neverwinter Nights?

I've read other romances by Beate Boeker, and I like her mix of light humor with sweet, clean romance, so I wasn't disappointed with this one.

953,"There's much to like about this book.  It's a fast, engaging read that left me feeling more confidence than dread.
What's interesting is this is really a book about entrepreneurship, but the author cleverly uses the threat of automation as a forcing function.

954,"Having lived in southern Germany for 3 years,  and visited many of the cities mentioned in the book, this was a fun read! Although the plot and characters were interesting, it seemed a little more character development would have brought some missing depth to the book.  At points the plot seemed to progress in soap opera fashion.",Well written and translated book.  Author keeps you guessing right up to the end.
955,"For starters, I love the artwork on the cover. However once you open the book, it will be hard to put down. A.I., clones, survivors, fighters, the future, or is it only a possible future depending on decisions today? Cliffhangers, discussion starters, finish the stories multiple ways.

962,"Intriguing story. Even through the scientific jargon and explanations I didn't skip any parts (which I sometimes do if it drags on too long or when I feel I get it already). The pace was good and the story jumps between different characters (what they are thinking and feeling) which keeps you interested and adds to the bigger picture of what is going on.

964,"Loved this book so much for its recommendations.  I never felt like I walked into some overly touristy place that was overcrowded and expensive.  This book is worth the Pisa day-trip instructions alone.  It gave us so much in understanding.  Stopping at some of the points and reading the background info (otherwise not available without a tour) helped to enrich our experience further.  I will say that the maps are useful unless you get lost because small in-between streets aren't on the map.

966,"After viewing the Tom Cruise movie, I had high hopes for the books and picked this one to read first.  I regret picking it up.  The words are set in interesting ways and the author clearly has a way of keeping the reader's attention, but this book reads like a Matt Damon movie but with more political undertones.  (If that's even possible.)
I'm not sure if I'll try another one of Child's books or not.  I'll probably skim through another at the library and decide then.","Like A Bond Novel, except the lead character is an unkempt, whiny, self-righteous wann-be draft dodger .  Thumbs down!"

969,Monica McCarty always writes a good story and this one is no different.  She knows how to keep your interest from beginning to end.  I like the way she weaves the background story along with the two main characters.  Monica keeps me reading one chapter to the next instead of skipping to the end of the story.  Not many writers that I have read have I not went to the back of the book to see how it ends.  To me that says this is a very good writer cause I can't put the book down till I've read it.

972,"Good book, very solid content and well presented --- the only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was because I was fortunate to have experienced one of Joe's speaking gigs and his energy is off the charts, this book wasn't that. It was more subdued which was a tad disappointing. Many times you can really feel the author's energy jump off the pages. The information was great though, I highly recommend it and if you get a chance to see Joe speak, run don't walk.

980,"This book is difficult for me to review. The writing is excellent, it pulls you into the story quickly. The subject is not one that is featured in a lot of romance stories, so it was very interesting. I just can't say that I enjoyed reading it. Many people loved this book, and I can see why.

As with the other two, the story here is propulsive and well-paced, the world richly imagined, but more than anything else, what I think I love is how well thought-through the consequences of everything is, both on the characters and the world. There's a heaviness to the protagonist, Sigrud, that resonated with me, but I think there was an essential hopefulness, too. I think that's something we could use right now.

I did feel, however, that if felt just a bit too long and painful for Darcy to be stuck as Collins, especially with Elizabeth falling in love with the man she thought was Mr. Collins.  Otherwise, I would have given 5 stars.",A humbling experience for Darcy switching bodies with Mr. Collins!

988,"Unlike a lot of how-to books now being hustled, Mckee isn't trying to sell you instant success. He's pointing out how great dialogue gets written. His method is Aristotelean: he names the parts and uses great works of literature as examples. Prodigiously well read in fiction, drama and film script, he shows you what's beneath the line, how to reveal only what's necessary to move the story, and how to gracefully layer in exposition through dialogue. He elucidates what is speakable for actors, and how to avoid traps and cliches.

989,"For a history buff, I thought this was an excellent read.

I wanted to learn more about the remarkable empire that was Khazaria, and this book did an excellent job. As a bonus, I enjoyed the detailed history of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe. I had no idea there were so many enclaves!

My only complaint is that the book starts off a little slow. You have to get thru the first chapter or two, but then it seems to take off like a rocket. I couldn't put it down after that.",Recommended for Learning about Khazaria and Jewish History in Eastern Europe
990,I've read the first 2 books of this series and I can't wait for part 3. This is by far my favorite series by Brenda Jackson. I like how she has combined the mystery and suspense with romance. It keeps you turning pages until the book is done. The characters are so rich with color and you can't help but fall in love with them all. It really teaches the lesson of how hard it is to trust outsiders. The Granger brothers are absolutely HOT. This is a must read.,favorite series yet. Brenda Jackson gets into mystery romance.
991,"This is the book that tells you what to do when you don't know what to do. Great for either narcissists or their family/friends/colleagues. Deals with three different types, not just the stereotypical narcissists. You can use the self-assessment quiz to help you fix your relationships.

It's an easy read ... the author makes you feel as if you're right there, every step of the way.  I also went through a similar lifestyle change years ago, so can relate to some of their experiences and the new learning curve you have to go through.  I highly recommend this book, you won't regret it.","Highly recommend this book ... interesting, fun, informative."
994,"I am normally not much of a reader anymore, but this book captured my attention.  Even though it took me a little while to get the book completed.  The story line took some twist and turns that I was not expecting.  It kept the book interesting and a fun read.  The characters came to life and I found myself literally in the book.  I can not wait until the next book comes out!  You did a great job Kara.....I am looking forward to reading more of your work.",Loved the story line.....can't wait for the next book in the series!
995,"Much of what was covered in the book has been addressed previously in the media. I did like the way the information was presented chronologically. Having Trump in office has been exhausting due to the level of chaos within his administration (much, of his own doing) that is reported on daily, but I had forgotten about some of his earlier escapades. I have to agree with the many comments that say the book is poorly written.","Nothing New, But the Chronological Order of Events is Helpful"
996,"Bajaj's Novel is a contemporary jewel in the tradition of Herman Hesses' Siddharta, as someone wrote before. The New York scenes in the very beggining are necesary, but don't reach the peak level of the rest of the book that is absurdly high. Perfect prose, trhilling, yet deep insights carachteristic of someone who deeply connects with it's subjects; meditation, non-duality and conscience. As much as a great novel, is also a very interesting guide to some insightful and important answers that trouble many westerner's minds.",A contemporary jewel in the tradition of Herman Hesses' Siddharta
997,"This story easily stands alone, but reads best as the 3rd in a series. The story moves quickly with well-developed characters to tell a story with a bit of mystery. Set during and after the Spanish Civil War (1930s-1950s). Ordinary, good people caught in Franco's fascism.
Zafon is a very good writer.  Many reviewers did not like this as well as the first 2 and called it darker. I heartily disagree; it is written in a less mysterious style and the excesses of Franco are not as glossed over, but it is every bit as good.","Slightly Different Style, But Just as Good as Zafon's First 2."
998,"This little novel is just perfect.  The characters are whole and well developed.  I fell in love with Joe and Charlie.  I completely identified with the narrator whose life span was the same as mine so she lived through events that I have lived through.  Even the characters on the outskirts of the story were real: Mr Golan, the parents, Alan.  It's a simple book which somehow takes many complicated events and puts them all together neatly into a tale of love and loyalty and friendship and survival.  I don't really know how else to describe it but you should read it!",Beautifully written. Lovely touching story spanning 40 years.
999,"In my view there are books that everyone should read.  This is one of them.  The Jungle Book is just a life lesson teaching classic.  Put in on your kid's Kindle or better yet, hand him the paper copy and then read or re-read it yourself.

1000,"And trust me, I've read them all.  The only thing is - if you have ZERO background whatsoever on this disease, or in science in general, don't start with this book.  Instead, start with one of the more general, introductory books like ""living with lupus"" or ""lupus q and a"" to just get a background because this is one heavy-duty book, laden with science that is very thorough, comprehensive, and sometimes complicated.  It's amazing though, and a must-read.  I'm VERY happy this exists.","The best, most comprehensive book on lupus available at this time."
1001,"I was given a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.  I honestly couldn't finish it.  I am sure it is meant for someone other than me and write my opinion with that as my basis.  I could see how this could be for men who were abused and raised in a strict church environment and don't understand their own sexuality.  I liked the idea of a lost journal found hundreds of years later and written about by a current blogger..  I, however, don't understand the need of some men to seduce young boys using their position or authority as a means of seduction.",For men who were abused and raised in a strict church environment.

1004,"Got this book because my little one loved Richard Scary's Big Book of Things That Go.  Thought this one would be neat because it was just cars and trucks.  It is neat, but it is tiny, pocket-sized, would fit in your purse.  Didn't catch that in the description.  It has turned out to be a nice, hearty car book though, so I would rate it good for that purpose.  Also, if you are looking for a toddler-proof board book intro to Richard Scary, this is good for that too.

He liked doing the decorating / glittering but and some of the gluing, but he was a little young for this activity.

1009,The plausible impossible would be a good description of this plot. It was suspenseful in parts and very predictable in others. Had an non disturbing underlying Christian theme.

1011,"As others have noted, it could have benefited from better editing...from someone who did some research about when helicopters were in use by the US Army--it wasn't even important to the plot, a truck would have done just as well.  In a nutshell, this book can be encapsulated as Monument Man becomes Indiana Jones; Einstein is literally bedeviled to help make atomic bombs; sex scenes are ""when it was over"".  The scenes that were supposed to be horror weren't even interesting.  NOT a page turner.  Don't waste your time.","Monument Man becomes Indiana Jones, Einstein is bedeviled...but it isn't even that good"

We bought a whole bunch of books by Julia Donaldson (mostly at Indigo stores here in Canada, so we can go through it to ensure the topic would be interesting to our little one).

1017,"I found this book to be very repetitive, I felt like I was waiting for something to happen. The characters are likable and easy to get to know.

1019,"There's simply no way to understand the cruelty, sadism, and inhumanity of the Nazis of WWII.  This book is a first hand account of someone who survived years of Nazi abuses in various concentration camps as a young Jewish boy from Poland.
Remarkably it appears that he has not let the memories of those horrendous experiences keep him from enjoying a rewarding life in America.  Perhaps those experiences taught him not to allow the precious moments of today and tomorrow to be tarnished by the anguish and rancor from yesterday.","Riveting first hand account of death, starvation & torture from Nazis"

Ginny, the sister-in-law, is a complement to the story since she embodies the aristocracy and the liberated spirit of a 20's flapper all in one.

They will be mislead to the qualities of the characters and the kindnesses and humane traits.  They will be left with feelings that the villagers  lack concern, compassion, and are all like Maria.

The story is a bit of Harry Potter for grownups, about two Englishmen in the early 19th century, learned in magic and acting on the world-stage of London and the Napoleonic European continent. The other venue is the land of faerie, with enchantments not at all charming, and with many evocations of England's great magician-king of long ago, John Uskglass.

 In Chloe Valcourt's dreams the world is lush - romantic -beautiful. She even encounters a handsome young man who she can't help but fall for. How can she make this alternate plane her reality? And is it even plausible? So looking for the rest in the series. A must read.",They say never judge a book by its cover-- but make an exception for Schasm!
1114,"I have read all of the series. The Lagercrantz additions don't have the same tension that builds up like the originals. While this was an enjoyable read it lacked the tension needed to make it a great read. Whenever, Lagercrantz puts the main characters in jeopardy you know sooner or later they will survive, because without them there is no story. It seems that the formula that worked so well was broken. Don't change it just turn up the volume.",The Lagercrantz additions don't have the same tension that builds up like the originals
1115,"There is so much information in this book about psychotropic drugs, their side effects, and reasons for their usage. I learned much about the use and risk of these drugs. There is also information about psychiatric disorders and very descriptive explanations of what these people undergo. Interesting information. I feel sorry for anyone who needs psychiatric care because their pain may be difficult to treat and the side effects of the medicines may be debilitating. An informative textbook that taught me a lot. I used it for my Abnormal Psych college class.",Everything you need to know about psychiatric disorders and medicines.
1116,"Greg Isles is very skillful at weaving together a complicated plot that includes historical references. However, younger readers who were not part of the Kennedy era in the 60's, may find the secondary storyline not as compelling as us older folks. I was totally invested in reading the book and wanted to know what would happen next, but felt some of the dire situations the characters found themselves in were a bit too far-fetched and exhausting. Of course I will absolutely read the final volume in this trilogy as I am definitely ""hooked""!","Somewhat less believable than ""Natchez Burning"", but still quite good."
1117,"This is the missing user's manual I never got with my chess board. I know that it is easy to think that if you know the rules to chess that this will be enough. However, you would be sadly mistaken if you make that assumption. The reality is that chess is an extremely advanced game and if you want to become a master, you need to learn the theory behind this game. In addition, you need to practice plenty. This book provides you with the theory that you must master in order to start winning!",A magnificent resource worthy of a quick read if you want to become a chess master!
1118,"When I was a new Christian, it was the biographies of Jim Elliot, Amy Carmichael and the like that inspired me to go to the mission field. This book offers a fresh insight into the struggles, triumphs, and joys inherent in cross cultural missions and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting an honest  and meaningful look at cross cultural missions in the modern day world.

1119,"Jane and Vincent have some real adventures in Venice.  As in real life, many of them they might have chosen to skip, but they learn to rely on each other more and deepen their relationship in a meaningful way.  Reading about the progress they make in their marriage is rewarding.

1120,"I've read most of Burke's work, but this is my absolute favorite. This is the perfect book for kids who love fairy tales, but whose parents don't want them reading books too dark and violent. As an adult, there were moments where I laughed out loud. I will be buying a paperback copy for my eight-year-old, and I know he will love it too.",Great tale for kids and adults who still haven't outgrown fairytales.
1121,"As I was reading this book I kept rolling my eyes. There was barely an original thought in this story. Between the way she finds out they are vampires to the fight between the two ""brothers"" this is a total knockoff of Twilight and Vampire Diaries. I was hoping there would be something new and original in this series but sadly I was disappointed.
That being said, I will continue to read the series to find out how the love triangle develops and perhaps the story will get more original. Also, at $0.99 it's not a bad deal.",What do you get when you cross Vampire Diaries with Twilight?
1122,"Personally I used the information from this book for a workshop that I presented on mind-body healing. The author wrote a great book, full of information and research yet it was fun to read and reread. I'd recommend this book to everyone who wants to know more about how our minds work. My motto is ""don't believe everything you think"" :)","fabulous book: informative, and a fun to read book for everyone!."
1123,It scares me how much I love this series. I am taking my time with reading this because it is soooo good. I recommend this book to ANYONE who is tired of the goody two-shoes protagonist. The first book blew me away and this sequel has me SHOOK. Love love love this and I really hope it can be made into a movie.,Dark humor and a relateable psychotic main character (or antagonist?) makes for an amazing read!
1124,Fragile X -- what an interesting way of introducing this genetic disorder.  I had never heard of it before but became enthralled with characters that lived with the disorder and those trying to make life for victims rewarding.  I do believe that all can learn but it takes some longer that others. I also believe that each and every person should be treated with respect and dignity.  This story line developed the victims personalities and the supported that my beliefs are well founded. The author developed  the fears and responsibilities of carriers of this genetic disorder.,the two plots twist together and make this an interesting story.
1125,Phenomenal! This book is an honest narrative which puts the facts together in a common sense way rather than spinning them. Dice is a real journalist who is covering what happened rather than what he wish happened. If you have not spent several years studying the origin and development of fake news then you will find this book truly informative because Dice has! His book is well researched as there are hundreds of news articles in the footnotes to back up his content. This book is exactly what it claims to be: the true story of fake news.,"An insightful, fact-based narrative from one of the last living real journalists."

The plot moves you from one page-turning scene to the next, exploring a fascinating topic that hasn't been the focus of a lot of fiction.  The climax, however, happens too quickly, leaving a long denouement that's a chore to read.  The end appears as an academic exercise, a venue for the writer's exploration of the concept of past lives.  This novel suffers from poor editing.

In this engagingly written book, he recounts his experiments with various approaches to keeping his blood sugar under control and rigorously documents the results, drawing conclusions/developing practical tactics that demonstrably work for him and that others can use to help manage their own diabetes.

It is smart and witty, has two great main characters, and fits into the 'smart romance' genre I like.

As a diehard Cubs fan I appreciate that the book is written from a longtime fan's perspective.

While I believe this book could have benefited from another round of editing to clear out the typos, the story is fantastic. It drew me in and it kept me there wanting to know what happened next.

It is well written, a plodding progression from bad to worse in a manner that is entertaining, if not a bit difficult for my reading to press on.  The book may be less light-hearted than many would chose to consider reading.  I do believe that, while being hardly up to the ability to create such a work, it might have been perhaps edited a bit more tightly to improve its pacing.

While Samuel Elliott Morrison's ""official"" history will remain as the classic account of the Navy in the Pacific, both volumes add substantially to the record, having the advantage of the passing of time and the availability of information that has been de-classified over the years, and access to the memoirs and records of Japanese naval officials.

There was enough story to keep it suspenseful (not in a thriller sense - but in terms of story interest), but the author did not drag on plot for the sake of length or sensationalism.

Pain Killers starts out interesting and readable, albeit twisted and sadistic. As the book goes along, it gets more absurd and in less of a good way. In that respect, the book loses it's ""charm.""

The chapters start with a short (I mean short) overview of the area, then it lists sites by mile markers. So for example the thermal area would be .5 mile _____. .75 mile ________. I found to really difficult to get my arms around what we wanted to see and what we could pass up. I wish I'd gone with a more traditional book.

As I was reading, it occured to me that the secret of this book's success is not simply his adventures in resturant kitchens, but reflects his ability to tell an engaging story.  Certainly, this book would not have been possible without his unique combination of writing talent and experiences in resturant kitchens.

1242,"Great book! My daughter's very inquisitive so this book is right up her alley. We've already had conversations about puberty but the book kind of seals the deal, so to speak. It solidifies what I've already told her and has opened the door to many conversations. It also helps her to know that every girl will experience these changes in their bodies too.","If you're not sure how to start the conversation about puberty, this book is a great tool."

My local branch offers ePub format books, including this one. I read it on my iPad, but a computer would have worked, too.

I've read the whole series so far. The stories were slight, but thoroughly enjoyable, and fill in some little holes I noticed in the books.","Good stuff, just what I expected, but they're charging way too much"

Driving past the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in 1950 I first heard about Bugsy Siegel (already dead). Visiting Cuba briefly, as a Marine Cpl. in '55 and again as a SSgt in '58, just before Castro took over, gave me some sense of the place.

It is a story I will visit again and again.",This is an adaptation of one of my favorite fairy tales and it was beautifully done
1249,"Love this character Joe Dillard. He has good morals and is willing to stand up for them. He is a bit of a loose cannon and is willing to pay the consequences for his actions.
The books involve violent murders. I'm not a fan of violence. That being said, the violence is not described in detail. It is stated matter of fact or it is alluded to.

1250,"I enjoyed reading this although there were many typos/grammatical errors.  It was still pretty darn good.  The characters were fairly well developed.  I enjoyed following them to see what would happen.  Henry Chandler was intriguing and I'm tempted to get the next book to find out more about him.  I'm not sure how I feel about the Atlantis/fallen angel thing though.  Although I wasn't sure of that, I did still enjoy the book.  It kept one going as things were pretty hairy almost from the get go.  Worth reading.",Fast paced.  You will be curious as to what's coming. Interesting characters.

This is my first read by this author and I've got to say if this is what I've got to look forward to then I'm all on board for reading more.  The chemistry between Owen and James was amazing, I loved the dialogue between the two of them and the snarkiness.

1258,Oversimplifications and flat incorrect statements detract from this poorly written attempt to explain physics. Perhaps the poor writing can be attributed to the fact that this is a translation. The philosophy of the last chapter is pessimistic and falls prey to the group think of climate change. The author implies that advances in physics derive from the influence of Italy and the Italians.,Oversimplification compromises what otherwise might have been an interesting book
1259,"It took a a chapter or two to get use to Wendig's writing style but its simplicity quickly grew on me. As far as the story don't expect to get a lot of detail about A list characters. The story mainly focuses on new characters and the setting is a short time after the destruction of the  2nd Darth Star so you won't get a lot of detail on the up coming movie either.

This is not light reading for the layperson, but if you can tough it out - it has some interesting parts.

Leaders are too often expected to give, give, give--with no time for their own personal spiritual assessment and refreshment. Paying closer attention to their own spiritual health--and the church or organization giving them the time and tools to do so--gives them the necessary framework to serve God and others with renewed energy and a fresh perspective.

There were many topics in this book that were very new to me and it addresses many difficult questions and issues that are not generally or frequently discussed easily among the church.

Natusch illustrates just how important it is to try to mend the broken relationships in our lives. To learn to be honest not just with others but with ourselves. She goes on to show how a coping mechanism can actually be detrimental to one's life if the issues are not dealt with. Undertow made me seriously reflect on my own life.,... be rather predictable but it did have some really good twists that contributed to it being a good read

But, the storyline is unimaginative. No spoilers, but she spends most of the pages of this book reminiscing over Lestat's past antics and trying desperately to cobble together a storyline around an impotent villain.

Still a good read for 90% of the population, I just expected something different (more in line with the first two books) from this author - maybe her fame and editors were getting to her to make it more ""real world"" or harliquin romance type - I liked reading love scenes better in the first two, left more to the imagination, which is always better for me.",Sequels regularly fail to meet the standard of the first book
1270,"I really enjoyed this book for the two reason I stated in my review title:

1) the book covers the theory on focus, concentration etc, to gain what you desire and want to see come about - practical without theory is had to trust, or believe in my view

2) the practical side - the book gives some very clever and powerful exercises to make this a simple, easy process

The alternating point of view, chapter by chapter (mother and daughter) was not only not confusing or distracting, it gave the story an incredibly richness.

It has recipes for just about anything one could think to cook, but the particular reason I wanted this edition, was because it explains to the novice HOW TO COOK and HOW TO deal with each category of food, for example, how to choose fruit or certain cuts of meat.

The darkness of the story makes you aware of the failings of society and as the characters develop you are drawn into their adventure.  The only drawback is that you finally understand where you are being led just as the story concludes.  You are left with a hunger to know more about these people especially if they are champions or demons...

The author made a place and characters come to life in this book. Very descriptive. Storyline has such a great flow to it, definitely not choppy from chapter to chapter! Recommended dark read with definite triggers! Love it! Can't wait for book two!!!",... Darkest cult books I've ever read and I flipping love it!
1306,"Interesting book with a lot of great commentary on current and past world issues, how the times have changed and how to evolve with them. It also discusses some other information that some would find really interesting such as ""Why to be a B corp"" , ""The Five Steps to Starting Your Own Social Enterprise"", and ""The Power of Patience"". Overall, even as a non-economics major and someone who reads often but not generally on such a pointed topic I truly enjoyed this book and have recommenced it to a couple friends in the early stages of their business and even to established ones.",Interesting book with a lot of great commentary on current and past world issues
1307,"I purchase this book not long ago at a local antique store for $19.00 and I was amaze and still reading the book as we speak. This book explains Martial Arts early beginnings, Karate from the Ryukyu Islands history, mainland Japan influence and modern Karate of today, plus several Katas from the Pinan series up to Yanstu and many others. From kihons to Kata bunkai which is a lost art in todays dojo and self defense for men and women, this book is a must for Kyokushin karatekas and Martial artist in general.",Early entry of Mas Oyamas book series that explains the basic fundamental of Karate and its essence to the core.
1308,"Good for little kids or strange teenagers who are weird. It is a good book. I like the pictures too.
But also a book that tells the story of a cute little horse that had the will and courage to survive. Add a group of loving humans,a protective mother,and and a very great uncle, you have a colt that couldn't die if he tried.",Young kids or weird teenagers are qualified.  Also a great story of survival.
1309,"A very well written short story about the beginnings of our dear friend Tenzin. It is not a pretty story and it certainly left me wanting more, but Elizabeth Hunter can't write all of Tenzin's 5,000+ year life span so this tidbit into Tenzin's early life was enough to placate my desire to learn about the beginnings of our Bird Girl.",It is not a pretty story and it certainly left me wanting more
1310,"I was given this book and at first I thought-oh what a silly book, but the more I looked through it-I actualy enjoyed it.  Very cute illustrations.  A very fun and interesting way to learn more about food in an interactive way.  A great book for a beginning foodie or someone in the culinary world-maybe just starting out?  I really enjoyed the fun foodie facts as well that were mixed throughout-short and simple.  A fun book for sure.",but the more I looked through it-I actualy enjoyed it. Very cute illustrations
1311,"This author writes very well and at 1/3 way through I didn't understand why some were complaining about the whining since the plot was good and the characters had a reason to be unhappy.  By 3/4 of the way through, I was with the people who were complaining about the whining.  From liking the book, to just wanting it to be over since it was too life like with the 'life happens and then you die' aspect.  So, I don't think I will buy more from this author, but for $2, I can't complain...oh, wait, I did complain. :^)",Good first 1/2 of book...would have been better all the way through w/o the whining and depression.  Add more action.
1312,"Terrible is an understatement for this short movie made by another stupid Michael Moore wanna-be. The guy goes to the middle-east to interview Jihadists and Islamists to hear them blame America for the Islamic terrorists' crimes. This shot movie is a one man journey to the Arab world and the silly purpose of it is to tell American viewers that Middle-easterners hate America and that war on terror is bogus because a Jihadist says so. Like the Islamic terrorism doesn't exist and therefore it shouldn't be combatted. Any how, I give this 73 minute documentary a zero star.","Blame America First. Twisted, wrong, incorrect and historically manipulative"
1313,"Not a grad student, nor am I going to be (and least of all not in literary theory). But I thoroughly enjoyed this book, to include the writing (not dense, though definitely not a breeze either). That I didn't know much about this world was a weakness, I felt, and so I read this and felt that it gave me a good over view of all the movements and so forth. Perhaps Eagleton comes across as condescending, but I liked that. Fact is, this book as allowed me to look into other books or speeches by him. Check this out if you're interested in this very specific world.","Great (only because I say solid too much), even for outsiders"
1314,"My daughter loves iCarly. She's obsessed. It's a common thing for girls and some boys in the 6-and-older crowd, and as long as the kids don't get a smart mouth like Sam, it's a fine and funny show.

This book is great for kids who love the show. iCarly is all about using the Internet, and the online elements are really interesting to kids who have been weaned on Webkinz and are starting to move on.

It's not a super-amazing book and the website elements aren't going to engage a child for too long, but it's pretty inoffensive.",iCarly Fans Will Adore This Book. Mostly Because it is About iCarly
1315,"I love looking through this thing. Detailed drawings and useful information abounds. Will look great on the shelf next to Arnold's Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding. If you're interested in finding out which muscles are used in a given exercise or finding exercises to work specific muscles, this book is a great resource. This book is not a guide on creating a lifting program. It doesn't list exercises to do, rep ranges, etc. What it does is provide the lifter with an anatomical/physiological guide on the body.",Fantastic resource for the lifter who wants to understand anatomy better
1316,This guy clearly harbors some pretty intense crush on Chris Kyle. This book does nothing but gush shamelessly about the legend of a man who didn't do anything more than most of our service men and women in combat. Chris kyle himself says his high kill record is strictly because of luck - being in the right place at the right time. Michael Mooney makes Chris Kyle out to be a mythological larger than life impossibly perfect superman.  Boring and cringe worthy saccharine flattery.,This guy clearly harbors some pretty intense crush on Chris Kyle
1317,"Wish every Christian I know would read this.... McLaren did a great job taking us down a path that few dare to tread... A path that leads us to a richer understanding of the Bible...a more benevolent view of God... And a deeper understanding of Jesus and His mission. If it accomplishes that, how could it be wrong or even questionable? The only reason Fundy's would find it dangerous is because it challenges the status quo and threatens to implode the current idol of religious institutions", provocative invitation into a richer experience of a good and gracious God.
1318,I have used excerpts from this book to enthrall and challenge my students about human potential and what blocks it. I very much enjoyed the accessible writing style and the real world examples. Would love to read an account of how organisations have changed and how they did it - like what training and systems have been developed. Many thanks for reviving my faith in the human ability to question in the easiest and most powerful way by simply asking why?,Being prepared to step up and ask the awkward question is the stuff of change and empowerment.
1319,"This book won't answer many questions or provide a detailed guide on how to build a business.

1321,"Going into reading this book, I was mentally prepared to read about the brutality and the monstrous acts that happen in real life boarder crossers. Coming from a family that have gone through the same and hearing all the sad stories were just horrible. This book speaks on all the issues and I had to skip through more than half the book because it was just TOO LONG, TOO DETAILED, AND JUST BORING. The only good facts about this was probably the middle a little and the last 15% I had higher expectations for this book, but It disappointed me...",Coming from a family that have gone through the same and hearing all the sad stories were just horrible

1323,"This is an Amazing Book. This could not have been more timely for me. The author clearly explains in short Real stories how Real Estate investors lost money due to lack of Due diligence, Lack of understanding of the Laws , naively believing other people ( like contractors ) .
I like the way the author summarises the Lessons learnt at the end of each Story. I really commend his effort to write this book.",Highly Recommend this book for Anyone considering getting into a Real Estate Investing.
1324,"It's been a while since i read this book and I tend to forget most of what i read because there so much. but this novel has remained with me enough that i recommend it pretty regularly. it's a brilliant story, the whole behind the scenes of the soviet union alone captured my imagination and then when the two lives intersected, well, i found it all so compelling. I never review anything because i'm lazy and because i find it so challenging to say something worthwhile. but i'm thrilled to learn about Cartwheel, her latest novel, since it reminded me of Partial History.",This is a brilliant novel! I'm extremely lazy but i stuck with this one.
1325,"I have been reading a lot about this subject for the past year or so trying to get educated about this important ""new"" marketing option for my business.  Mostly I have found things that are hard to understand or not relevant to my needs.

Highly recommend it!",True to the title!  Makes understanding this easy... great book -- Highly recommmend!
1326,"Scott Brick's narration of ""The Innocent"" moves right along and never lets up.  Ex-con Matt Hunter is basically set up for a double homicide and needs to stay one step ahead of the authorities so he can clear his name.

That sounds like the plot of a typical grade-B mystery movie, but Harlan Coben takes that plot and makes it work gloriously.  Unfortunately he then tries to tie up too many loose ends by giving explanations that are somewhat far-fetched, to put it mildly - and the last one is the most unbelievable of all.  But the story still works, which is very surprising.",Too many coincidences in the resolution but still a good book
1327,"Another great addition to this already awesome series.
Blaze and Katrina's story was wonderful. From start to finish I could not put it down.

Absolutely recommended.",A volume that matches its predecessor in every way--a splendid read
1330,"There's nothing wrong technically with this coloring book.  The pages are on decent weight paper.  The designs are on single sided white paper and removable.  Gel pens and colored pencils do great and, of course, you can use fine point ink pens for small places without bleed through.  My only issue is the designs are just too corny for my tastes.  It's a little too ""grandmotherly"" if that's a fair critique?",The pictures are boring & kind of old fashioned.  (Just my opinion )
1331,"I enjoyed the story as an interesting way to learn more about the French peoples' involvement in helping Allied aviators avoid being taken by Germans during WWII. I liked the way the story unfolded and how you came to know the characters. It seemed a little slow but I felt like that added to the tension of wondering if you were going to find out more. (Possible spoiler alert ahead ...) The ending left me hanging a bit, but I guess it's one of those that leaves it up to your imagination what ultimately happens. Overall, I liked the story and would recommend it.","Interesting, personal story and perspective on Allied aviators in WWII and the French people who helped them"

Nero!!!! Loooove him! I mean love the hell out of him.

The book is laid out quite well and literally has a stepping stone process that is great for someone like me.  The first bit of the book is informative but I feel like it tries to sell itself a little too much.  I'd have rather she just get right to it.  Well worth getting through however.

1338,THE HOBBIT has always been one of my favorite books and I have read it several times since I was 11 years old when my aunt bought me my first copy. It's been a while since I last read it and after seeing the recent trilogy of THe Hobbit movies felt I needed a refresher. I nearly forgot how much I love this book. How it transports me. And how it makes me feel like I'm 11 reading it for the first time.,A timeless piece of literature...and a bit of nostalgia for this reader.
1339,"Based on the subject, it's fantastic. I've been doing C# and OO programming for years and got just recently interested in and mesmerized by some functional languages. The book is pretty rich in FP aspects, it walks through most of them and discuss them in C#. It didn't miss monads, mapreduce, lazy evaluation and listing...

As other people said, it could have been better written. I opened the book with the excitement and the feeling I'll probably fall in love with it, but it didn't happen. The book was interesting, but failed to captivate me the way other books did.","Fantastic subject and great coverage, but somehow fails to captivate"

I guess I won't know until I read the next one!",Just know that Boyd Morrison has GOT to be working on another one! Wahoo!
1344,"Yes. This fine book written around 2001 was almost brilliant. Bible does talk, say, in a sense of molecules making up life forms. As it it points out.

I never give up on books but this books is feeling like a chore.

This book sucks.",This book is a Parable about the dangers of horrible writing.
1353,"Just finished reading Lev Grossman's terrific ""The Magicians"" series. It's a portal fantasy with elements of urban fantasy. The hipster characters are ironic, and aware of Harry Potter and Star Wars, and often noting the ridiculousness of their circumstances. But in spite of the cynical tone of many of the characters, the books are filled with joyous creativity about the magic. It's a delightful escape that sticks in your mind long after it's over. There is also a TV show about the series that I also enjoyed.","Just finished reading Lev Grossman's terrific ""The Magicians"" series"

They bought a very old barge and proceeded to gut the interior themselves and put in bedrooms and other living areas.

Poorly written and clearly evident that there was no deep research on the unit and events - other than that found in the official unit history records or the authors personal account. Amazingly, there are no footnotes or references to substantiate some doubtful statements.
Large portions related to the 1976 Angola incursions seem to have been directly taken from other books on the subject.

I am a avid reader; reading thousands of books. In my opinion ""God's Creative Power for Finances"" is a great book!  What I appreciated about this little gem is the author gives clear instructions on the ""how to"" take control of your finances and it correlates with the Bible's instructions.

To be frank it's been so long since I've read them, I don't remember the specifics. However, as an astronomy geek, whenever I hear reference to Antares or Procyon, these titles always come back to mind, with fond memories of being drawn into a fascinating, long term plot, a strange alien connection and some pretty cool explorations into technology.",...

1367,"This ARC was given by Random House Publishing Group - Loveswept via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

3.5 stars : Was it just me or did this book make you want to find out what was happening now instead of the various flash backs throughout the seven years Joss and Matt knew each other? It made you curious right from the start to see their relationship and how sorbet sex came about. This book contained humor regarding various horrible dates/relationships they each experienced.

1370,"I love this book a lot. The fact that the MC is a girl singing tenor is the way straight to my heart. On top of that, I appreciated Jordan's thoughts about gender, and I thought gender was handled pretty well throughout the book. (Having trans characters in addition to the mentions of trans people would have made it even better.)

But this is a book that is really about relationships -- platonic, romantic, and familial -- and empathy and trust, and I love its portrayal of all of those things.",Beautiful book about relationships (and a girl who sings tenor)
1371,"His book, ""Love, Miracles, and Animal Healing,"" was so wonderful I didn't think even he could top that.  But this book takes animals and their persons to the next level.  He has opened to door to all, including other veternarians, of the depth and sense of community we have with all our animals.  I believe - no, I know that animals have emotions just like us - and that their unconditional love links them to us as only soul mates can!",Allen Schoen did it again!  His love of animals is so inspiring!
1372,"David McCullough is such a fine writer and story-teller. I always learn from his history and biographical work, and enjoy doing so. I knew some of the Wright Brothers work (and work ethic) here in the US, but I knew nothing about their accomplishments in France, and the importance and influence it had on our government to seriously begin to work with them. It was also fascinating to learn about their family and the role that they played in all of they accomplished.",Fine story about the pioneer Wright Brothers from a fine writer
1373,"Very well crafted !The book grows with the hobbits in it. In the beginning, it is not only Frodo and his companions that are young, the book is too. And this is vividly seen from Tolkien's style of writing which starts out very simple, but by the time it reaches the war of the ring you know that the although the hobbits have been worn and torn, they have also all grown up now, and has the book.

In particular, the story of Eli's connection to the Comanches is powerful.",A wonderful look  into the history of Texas by the  telling of one fictional family's story
1375,"This is without a doubt the disappointment of the year for me! I LOVED each of books in The Hawk and the Dove series, but this book reads like a rough draft that should have never made it to the publisher. It is as though Wilcock did not even finish the book. It abruptly ends and lacks the readability and depth of her previous works.",This is without a doubt the disappointment of the year for me

The family that became Pippa + Eric + Julie, was super sweet. I love how they just clicked together, like they were always family. I love how sweet and very toned Pippa and Erics story was, compared to the other two books. Of course I really enjoyed the how the story is set in San Francisco, my favorite city.

I will be buying additional copies for friends who become fathers.",The first fathering book that I have ever read that I wished I would have read before I became a father
1381,The author demonstrates a strong grasp of Eastern and Western medicine methodologies.  I like the fact that the book spent more effort highlighting the correlations between Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine explanations instead of using this book as a platform to declare the superiority of one practice over the other.  I left this book with a sense that both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine can be used to enhance or balance rather than cancel out one another.,"More East Meets West Than East Versus West, and The Book Is Better For It"

1383,"Lauren Smith's Legally Charming is the first in the Ever After series.  A fairy tale in the making from the first chapter, but with a few bumps along the way.  The author has done a solid job in creating characters that are well positioned against and with one another.  Jared may be the bad boy to start off the story, but what we see if this story is one with much more underneath and now he's on the prowl for his princess.

If you have to sell it higher, then make it $15.95 for a kindle. I have read a sampling of the book and it seems to be worth the money. But not at one hundred dollars. Really, on a Kindle book there is no expenses for ink or paper just pure digital information. I would rather buy Neuroscience for dummies.

Buyer beware there is a warning that is really saying this might not work and the author is not responsible. Anyone who is selling an idea to get rich obviously didn't make enouph money on the business model in the first place.

And the food industry is notorious for working behind-the-scenes to hype up the benefits of any given ingredient (think whole grains) in order to sell more of it.

1388,"Very informative information about the Great War, the upper class and the highly restricted role of women in society in pre-War Britain.

1389,"I find Rabbi Sacks essays on the weekly Parsha the most interesting and convincing being written today. While he does use his broad background in political science and his understanding of the wider culture in his essays he always does this in a way that helps illuminate the Jewish religious meaning of the text. He is not a simple show -off throwing around his wider knowledge as some commentators have become.

1390,"I'm a Harry Turtledove fan, and am willing to overlook a lot of flaws in his writing if the basic idea is fun or intriguing. But a novel with a one-dimensionally insufferable character whose transformation makes him one-dimensionally selfish violent and cruel just won't work magic. The religious system (Zoroasterian or Manichee) where 2 one-dimensional gods battle it out could have been treated imaginatively, but this never got off the ground either.","When the central character is obnoxious and boring, the novel doesn't work"

The book does seem to be a bit repetitive going on and on about how ""wild"" & unconventional Chip is and how they never expected their lives to turn out this way.  I like the fact that even with the fame from their show, they still seem to stay good, honest down to earth folks.  If you enjoy the show, you'll probably enjoy the book.

Terry Irving has recreated the era and the atmosphere in DC so well that it felt like I worked with him then. In fact, I did join ABC News but not until the 1980s.

It's an excellent summer read.",I wasn't sure I'd like Courier what with all the motorcycles and facial hair
1399,"I hate it when writers leave teaser endings to get you to want to read the next book to find out what will happen next.  In this book, the author manages to write a teaser ending and give a sense that the characters got their well-deserved happy ending too.  In the last two books the endings felt depressing.

This one has a more hopeful end.",This book had a more satifying ending than the first 2 in the series.

Death needs to be discussed with young kids, this book just isn't a good example of how to do it.

Second: When writing poetry, one should never sacrifice rhythm and meter just to fit a rhyme in.  Far better to keep the meter, and sacrifice the rhyme.  The writing is very amateur.

I appreciated what the book was trying to do, it just didn't do it effectively at all.","Badly written, no meter, no rhythm - I wouldn't put a kid through listening to this"

1434,"I became a bit bored with the shallow characters after a bit of reading. It was interesting to see how the author's mind took a similar theme (much like Jane Austin!) and beat it to death.. It is certainly a cultural situation since my day growing up on Betty Friedan and the then new women's movement! Interesting to go through his early magazine stories, but his Great Gatsby was certainly the height of his state if mind being transferred to his writing.

You rock David Archer!",If only David Arcger could write this series as quickly as I can read them!!!! I NEED more!
1436,"While the writing is somewhat dry and lackluster, the history of this amazing woman, combined with the beautiful illustrations, still makes for an interesting read. The text is a little overwhelming, chronicling Alonso's life in what sometimes reads like a list of encyclopedia entry, not engaging the reader as much as it could, but the accompanying pictures and overall story are so interesting that it almost doesn't matter. Just bear in mind this is only a picture book in the sense that it is a book with pictures.

The book covers how to get the right people on your team, keep them engaged and measure that engagement. Ironically, it comes off as a little dry as the images aren't engaging. Go figure!

Coffee With Ray is for the music instructor, or, really anyone who is both teacher and student of life, providing encouragement and perspective with a dose of humility and humor.

It was quite an unexpected pleasure to read Squall Lines and see how he evolved from an insightful and funny college ""author"" to an insightful and really freaking funny author who views the world and all assorted nuts and still makes us laugh out loud and wish we were Serge Storms for a little while.

She is taking her son across the country, from New York to Los Angeles, to reluctantly re-unite her son with his estranged father. Through descriptions of comic-book stories and TV show episodes, we find out more about our cast of characters and what's brought them to this point.

1448,"Book Two of Outlander - this time with more political intrigue!

I mostly enjoy Gabaldon's writing style - she has a knack for making the scenery feel real without TOO many adjectives. Enough to forgive the handful of random SAT words sprinkled throughout.

My only downside is because of my age (64) and looking to retire in 2015, I am looking for ways to enjoy my retirement and the book seems to put more emphasis on what a younger, still looking to grow with a company, type of person should be doing NOW.

From the beginning it gives the impression of a future life where people (including the main character, a young man in high school) are ""spaced out"" nearly all the time because life is so mundane and difficult. I am following the teenager who lives in his skin when he has to, but is mostly going through an other experience like someone on drugs.

Very well written and thought provoking. The veneer of humanity is indeed thin.,Thought provoking psychological study of how ordinary men succumb to evil
1469,"My favorite aspect of the story was the continual lampooning of wedding planners and weddings that have spun out of control.  The bride in this story agonizes over the details of her dress without displaying any humanity or sympathy for anyone, it sounds lame but is fun.

It's a boy's coming-of-age story, maybe the style was intended to be in the voice of the adolescent boy. If so, it sort of turned me off.

1492,The simple title of this introspective study of a life and historical period is deceptive. Beginning it seemed to be a casual story of a young ladys romance during the years a father's approval of courting was customary. The first surprise was the comment of the bride to her bridegroom that she didn't love him. From there the intrigue grows. As it follows a Jewish family through several generations and especially their trials of war and Nazi conquest you sometimes hold your breath eagerly scanning the page. The final conclusion ties the story together beautifully.,Historical story of struggle of Jewish family relationships and life of Charlotte.
1493,A very interesting account of automatic writing and the transmission of knowledge and experience of the afterlife. There is nothing to fear about death.

The plot in this book is intriguing and had me guessing for a while, which I love, and as far as action, it arrives in no time at all.

Those who are familiar with other Mantle bio's know well of his fall from grace in in his later years, but this book is about the zenith of his career.

With rich and descriptive language, Peper intertwines an exploration of inner values with a well-plotted mystery. A page-turner that deserves my enthusiastic and unconditional recommendation.

However, I still found it fascinating as I'd had no idea that this existed.  Certainly, there were a lot of surprises, twists and turns to the story and I appreciate that the author offered it for free.  Definitely enjoyed it, and would rate it closer to 3.5 stars.  Enjoyed the way it linked the various family mysteries and a very satisfying outcome to the ending.  Worth your time!","Interesting history of Aquifer geology, set in a romance and UFO story."

Yes there is description of his many categories of iris, but not much discussion about why someone would choose them for their garden.  It isn't so much a guide to bearded irises, as a book showing SOME of them.

As others have said, it's told from the perspective of many people, and its honesty and authenticity shine through.  One thing I would add it that Lalechka did not have an easy time in Israel as she was growing up, and even into adulthood.

The series started out strong and has just gone a bit downhill every book, until the latest is hard to care about.

1566,I gave this book 3 stars which isn't a high score but yet I enjoyed the book.  It was a quirky book and some of the other reviews I saw before I even read the book were not positive.  Yet I think it's worth reading for the quirkiness alone.  The mystery the book is based around is of a baby that that was found on a family owned island by two sisters.  The story goes that the sisters said the baby was found alone and that the parents were missing.  The girls raised the baby themselves and made money on the lore of this story.

1568,"It has a slow buildup, sometimes too slow. And some of the reactions, especially in Charlie toward the middle, I found a little over the top. Yes, the endoskeletons are a little creepy but it seems somewhat unbelievable to say that she played while Dad tinkered and that she picked up bits almost dispassionately in the beginning, and flipping it to the eyes and arms and gears in her hair make her flail frantically. And the relationship with John feels really forced.
But I did like the book for what it was. And after it picks up, it gets (mostly) better","A good addition to FNAF lore, character development could have been better"
1569,"I found this book to be a little flat compared to the previous Annika Bengtzon novels.  The story seemed to ride up and down like a roller coaster and was a bit fantastical.

This book is in English and was written for German children who are learning English. Some of the words are in italics and have their German meaning at the end of the chapter.  But it will do great for any American child who wants to read the story, and they can learn a little German at the same time.

Getting you to examine what your desires are and writing them down is more than most of us do, even though  proven you really need to.

1580,"Finding one's way through life and its relationships is a twisted trip. As Amanda counsels Clover, ""You stop thinking about the things that haven't happened and think about the things that are happening, or might happen.""  That is good advice, and the plot of this novel crosses many borders to get to the nail-biting conclusion.  No book in recent memory has more strongly tweaked my desire to look at the ending prematurely--but I did resist, even when the going got almost creepy.

The images just pop off the page and look far better than in any other SW book I've ever seen. You don't have to be into fashion to get a lot of value out of this book.

There are lots of red herrings, good because the heroine lives on a boat. The series, that I imagine follows this, should be worth reading also. There were only a very few typos or misused words.","Enjoyable read with some changes from the usual formula, but still another cop potential boyfriend."

The literary technique is entertaining, but the ""plot"" can basically be summed up as ""two guys go to Las Vegas for a week, totally baked on every mind altering chemical known to man"".

I felt like the big reveal was already known and diminished the excitement, but then there was a second one that was also a given and not super realistic.

1591,"This book is a sociological examination of the Black Plague's effect on medieval Europe. I read it because I am interested in the Plague, but it is barely mentioned. I learned a couple of new things in this book, but I found it rather dry and tedious.

The plot is delightfully complex and realistic, causing the reader to think about what is beyond the surface of what we perceive. It's a cautionary tale about our dependence on electronics, the slow death of language as we know it, and how meanings are relative.

1602,"I got 20% of the way through and found that I couldn't keep going.  The plot was a bit predictable at that point (girl thinks she likes the bad boy, but will really like the good guy in the end) and the writing, while solid, is more aligned with a novice writer than the quality literature that I've been reading.

1630,"For those of us who love to travel, to meet new people, experience cultures, customs and cuisene of other countries....this is a total delight!  The author returns to the culture of her heritage, spending the dream of 90 days in the city of Florence.

Relish and enjoy every page as if you were there yourself!!","'Returning' to live the culture of ancestors, traditions, and heritage!"
1631,"Very interesting, learned a great deal about various infectious deceases.  Some of the parasites are really bad, don't travel to 3rd word countries our eat salads in any restaurant!  Plus, it really pays to get multiple opinions, because many doctors can be wrong and of course their opinion if wrong could kill you.  It is difficult to imagine what life was like before antiseptics and antibiotics.  Great book, if you  are not a hypochondriac.","Good book but may end up upsetting so people, there is a lot out their waiting for you if you are compromised!"
1632,"Being from N.C. and a student of the Civil War, I found this book very interesting. The author, Leon Louis named towns and places in my state that I live near and described the way they looked to him 150 years ago.  Even if you are not a N.C native you will find Louis' descriptions of everyday soldier's life during this period of great interest.",C native you will find Louis' descriptions of everyday soldier's life during this period of great interest.
1633,"An interesting anthology of short stories combining twenty different author's characters together.  As many of the stories start in medias res, it takes some effort on the reader to jump into gear with each individual story arc.

That said, it was fun to see some of my favorite characters interacting with other characters.  As should be expected, the stories containing characters for series' I've read were more interesting than the ones I haven't, but all in all a very good anthology for those who love Urban Fantasy.

Disclosure: I received a courtesy copy for review.",All in all a very good anthology for those who love Urban Fantasy.
1634,"Wow ... what a gem! I blazed through this book and my sleep took a serious hit! The pace of the book was just right, moving the story along without skipping key parts. And while I tend to shun coming of age stories, this story felt quite different to me, I just couldn't put it down. I highly recommend this book and how C. Greenwood redefines a strong, competent heroine. Fantastic read. After I hit the ""submit"" button for this review, I am downloading Book 2! Can't wait!",A Surprising and Compelling Story ... the Heroine Re-invented!!
1635,"A remarkable description of the times 1939-45.  Everything this man has written is true.  He had so much  courage.  Also the arrogance of the young men who followed Hitler without thinking and the bullying, yes I have seen and heard it myself.  I have read this book with great interest and did a lot of reminiscing. It brought up a lot of memories I would rather have forgotten.  Also the translation is excellent.  I recommend this book also for it's historic value.",I have read this book with great interest and did a lot of reminiscing
1636,"In general, an excellent read. The characters are interesting and consistent throughout, as is the background. The use of period or variant language is likewise consistent. The magic system is interesting, the plot is twisty, the ending deeply satisfactory, with just a hint of ""to be continued"". There are a couple of places in the middle where the multiple flashback story framework and the related repeated cliffhangers got a bit predictable and tedious, but keep going, the story is worth it. As usual with Ms. Walsh, I find myself very much looking forward to more.","If you love Georgette Heyer and Patricia C Wrede, you'll love this."
1637,"Sophie Simon is a gifted third grader who uses her noodle to solve her classmates problems.  I was really charmed by this book.  The story is clever and funny which will appeal to adults reading it with their kids, yet it never speaks over kids' heads.  The illustrations are also really endearing.  I ended up buying several copies for my nieces and nephews, and they all loved it as well.  We can't wait to read the future adventures of Sophie Simon!",Charming without being cloying - perfect for your own gifted young ones!
1638,"Cook's Illustrated have once again provided excellent recipes with detailed how and whys. The recipes in here are amazingly good.  Better yet, the testers at Cook's Illustrated give tutorials on the how and why the recipe goes together.  You learn better ways of doing things while you produce amazing food.  This is one of THE best cookbooks I have purchased.",If you are looking for great slow cooker recipes look no further!
1639,"As an emergency physician, military history buff, I seek out books like this. I am not a veteran.  It is a series of different persons' stories written by a physician at a military hospital in Japan. It provides a feel of the Vietnam experience. If you enjoyed ""The Things They Carried"" by Tim O'Brien, this book will provide a similar expeience. It sticks with you.",The Vietnam experience relayed by a physician who treated and then reported the stories.
1640,"Ms. Saunders has a great writing style - one that kept me captivated to stick with the book. ""Effective time investment"" is a different way of looking at time management. I thought her approach in how to look at time as an investment rather than a ""chore"" made me more motivated to incorporate some of these habits. I am a fan of David Allen's, GTD, and I definitely have started incorporating some of the habits from Ms. Saunder's book. IMHO, there is no one formula to effective time management. I look forward to her future publications.",Ms Saunders has given us a different way to look at time management
1641,"I found Rosenberg's philosophy quite a departure--and a good one. I've read the book twice. If there were a downside for me, it is in the examples of  communication he uses to illustrate his philosophy. I found them a bit stilted, almost too technical--not given to ordinary discourse. I think the truth is there; but I wouldn't see myself discussing a topic with another person in quite the way he suggests.",I found Rosenberg's philosophy quite a departure--and a good one.

She is told she is being shipped off to the ends of the kingdom to marry and Ani's life gets flipped upside down- literally.

Cute story! I couldn't put it down and read it in a day! Great read for young or old (like me!)!!",What would you do if your lady-in-waiting was jealous of you and wanted to steal your identity?
1643,"MK Tods book Unravelled is a perfect start to a story that ends with Lies Told In Silence. Both books are centered around World War 1. There is romance, intrigue, and action from two world wars in Unraveled, told from a Canadian point of view. Her follow-up book was from the French point of view. Unravelled starts with a trip back to France, where long-ago memories and feelings are stirred up, and end with more secrecy in another world war, and more longing and romance. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend it to all who like romance, intrigue, and wartime action.","A must read for anyone interested in war, romance, and intrigue. Unravelled has it all"
1644,"I was so excited when this showed up on my kindle. I couldn't wait to read it and find what was going to happen after the cliffhanger from the first book. I was not disappointed, it definitely lived up to my expectations. There was angst, drama, emotional roller coaster ride, and a whole of love. I loved every word of this book and could not put it down. These two authors definitely have a of way of making you feel every emotion there is to feel while reading. I can't wait for their next collaboration together.","I was not disappointed, it definitely lived up to my expectations"
1645,"I would give this novel10 stars if I could.....I loved it!  Everything about this story was thoughtfully developed:  characters, storyline, location, culture, history.  Not only was it interesting, but educational in a non-boring manner.  I loved the main characters, hated the villians, yet was completely intrigued by each of them.  I highly recommend ""The Sultan's Wife"" and now plan to read other novels by this author.  Great job, Jane Johnson!",I loved it! Everything about this story was thoughtfully developed
1646,"This is a wonderful book covering many topics - Christian living, family, stewardship, all the emotions. She incorporates Scripture into the prayers and there is a section at the back that gives the references and the actual verse. If you just don't know what to say to God about some issue in your life this book will help you!",This is a wonderful book covering many topics - Christian living
1647,"like I wrote, the writer discusses similar topics as other in this category, yet has some interesting and at times opposing insights. So, that's always great, never believe the first thing you hear, read, see, don't be lazy, save yourself time, money, dignity, etc...and always do the reasearch people.","Just started Reading, but so far it's great, like a second opinion at times"
1648,"The book did meet my expectations, but it also left many questions unanswered. I gave the book to a young friend of the family, a thirteen year old girl, who has been reading the Hunger Games, and Divergent series. She enjoyed the book but said it was almost too tame and not a very deep read. I admit the short page count, but after-all, it was a standard mass market paperback, not a 600 page mega novel. I still liked the book, and it was set in my neck of the woods (Du Page County/Glen Ellyn). I'm just sorry that the author never continued the series. It might have tied up some loose ends.","A good middle school read, covering a post-apocalyptic situation in the western suburbs of Chicago."
1649,I absolutely love this author and have read all his other books. This was the first book I bought on Audibles and found the APP very delightful. I read listened to the book in one day. Its a rather quick read and such a fantastic book. All his books have an awesome spiritual message however this one also had a mystery theme which I loved.,I absolutely love this author and have read all his other books
1650,This book captures the very essence of how the smart companies go about Monetising Innovation(s). I highly recommend this book. Excellent and easy to comprehend in every way. You just have to do it right the first time as doing it over again can mean that a competitor can gain ground on you and eat into your margins.....Why not learn from those that know how? Save yourself the unnecessary hassles and Win! Monetising Innovation is a must have.,This book captures the very essence of how the smart companies go about Monetising Innovation(s)
1651,"This book makes no sense at all! The heroine was plain confusing. One minute she's strong and froward saying what she wants, the famous, I can't tell him/I'll tell him later! How silly. The same old story with the same old ignorant hero, and childish pregnant heroine! Everybody's superficial and dumb!","Another forced drama, same old story, with ignorant pea brain characters!!"
1652,"Maybe it's the vastness of the subject matter but it seems as if this book is TOO basic.  Not sure how he would address it without making the book thousands of pages long, but I came away kind of disappointed, it didn't really give me lots of useful and interesting information like I'm used to from his series.",Decent and similar to his other works...but not quite the same
1653,I haven't finished reading this book but of what I have read and the list of products that he suggests can't do anything but good for you.

1654,"I heard about this book years ago, but I didn't buy it.  I thought it was hokey, so I avoided it.  Then I decided I should buy it and read it.  I am so glad I did.  His advice is spot on, even after years and years have passed.  I guarantee that you'll find some useful information  - something you can use today.

This is one of my recommended must read books.  The longer you wait, the more you'll miss out.  Don't be like me.","Even though this book was written some 70-80 years ago, the advice is still sound"
1655,"I first read these in grade school, and checked the same books out from the library over the years from time to time. They are bittersweet fantasy, sweet and beautifully written. Tolly's and Ping's and Ida's and Oskar's adventures are timeless, set in the same timeless English manor house the author lived in. I consider these a necessary series of fantasy literature, good for children of all ages.","The Green Knowe series is a must-read for all children, and adults"
1656,The premise of this book is a lot like Jurrasic Park but it has so much more.  The description of the area is vivid and exciting along with the action.  In places it is a little violent and descriptive. Matthew Riley has hit a home run with this one I think.  You know that Dragons have never existed in your mind however he can make you believe they did and can even make care about some of them.  It is worth the ride if you are looking for excitement.,The premise of this book is a lot like Jurrasic Park but it has so much more
1657,The Stephanie Plum series makes me giggle out loud and this novel did not disappoint.

All the same old characters are back and Grandma Mazur is again at her finest.,... me giggle out loud and this novel did not disappoint. Ranger has a vulnerable side (who knew
1658,I was drawn Into Rylee's world from the start. The book has a fast pace that keeps you turning the pages as fast as you can read them. This was my first experience with Shannon Mayer and I would highly recommend her works. In my opinion this is a good fantasy book to take your mind away from everyday stuff. Happy Reading!,Highly entertaining! Can't wait to read the rest of the series!
1659,"I'd give the story and writing five stars.  But 3 stars for the quality of the book's assembly.  On the first pass through the book, a cluster of four pages became detached from the binding.

But the text of the book is illuminating - at least half of it is devoted to the heroic efforts of the Chinese, and Ted Lawson's injuries (much worse than the movie portrayed).  It also included a few pics.

So I'm glad I got the book - I just wish I had picked the hardcover version.

UPDATE:  I got the Kindle version instead of a hardcover.  MUCH better!",Paperback version leaves a little to be desired - the Kindle version is fine
1660,"Such an emotional rollercoaster! I loved all three characters, and the dynamics that each of them has with each other. This is such a page turner; I read it so quickly. I returned this book and immediately started the sequel the same night. It's that much of a cliffhanger. I'd definitely recommend it!!",Such an emotional rollercoaster with well-developed characters
1661,I recently bought this for my daughter because it was my favorite book growing up. Unfortunately she hasn't had a chance to read it yet because I stole it from her right away and have been re-reading it! Haha. It's just such a perfect mixture of little girl and growing up. I read it when I was 10. This book brings back so many happy memories. I think it's good for any girl aged 9-15.,... bought this for my daughter because it was my favorite book growing up
1662,"This book is very difficult to write a review for.  It was NOT what I was expecting from the summary given on Amazon.  This has a lot of darkness to it.  Raya has an abusive step father, there is murder involved, rape, etc.  This is not a typical love story.  Raya is a very strong teenage girl that goes through hell and back.  She moves to a new town and meets Duke.  There is a mutual attraction.  They have strong feelings for each other before Raya's hellish life begins.  That love carries on even though they separate.  It's a great story, but be prepared, some of the books is hard to read.",Very emotional read!  Beware - there is some dark stuff in here!
1663,"This book was chosen by one of our book club buddies who was looking for a book about the past with all the crazy  things that happened . It was well written with the way things happened. It was ""fun"" and classic things that kids ""thought  they could get away with but got caught"". The kind of stuff that we heard about at ""Class Reunions "" .",Laughed my way through this walk through the life in the 1950+
1664,"Patchett does it again with a charming, intellectual, challenging novel.  I don't think it will substitute for Bel Canto as my favorite of her novels, but it is definitely a close second.  There was so much depth to the novel and I looked forward to reading more every time I sat down with it.  It could have gone on much longer as far as I was concerned.",I don't think it will substitute for Bel Canto as my favorite of her novels
1665,"I got the Kindle version of the book at launch as I'm very interested in the world of peer to peer lending. I really do think that this is going to be one of the next big things for investors to get into, and this book does a good job laying the groundwork giving a background on the industry in general, as well as giving the backstory of how Lending Club  was founded - and how they've grown so quickly.

Could this man been that wonderful?  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",Could this man been that wonderful? I thoroughly enjoyed this book
1667,Love the thought experiment by this author. Using the sensibilities of the Victorian period in her characters she creates a world where the summoning of the dead by mediums who connected to the other world during that era were credible because ghosts were real.  I especially appreciated her descriptions of the filthy air in London in those times and the manner of travel.,Jane Austin voice for the world of ghosts and their mediums of the Victorian Era
1668,"Let's face it, people in all their varieties can be trying to understand. The author apparently has had vast experience with parents in all their infinite complexity. Her wry comments on the realities of dealing with the public were spot-on, and I can't wait to try out her advice on the next troubled soul that walks in my door. I love that she advocated having, and sticking to, principles while trying to find a common ground without undue pressure on the teacher to appease.","Even as a 20-year veteran teacher, I found so much in this book to help me."
1669,"Another great Michael Connelly book. Harry Bosch is the best of the best. Harry will never disappoint you.

Bad guys who aren't so bad, and a lot of mystery.  And of course, undying love:)  My favorite part.  I could  not decide until half way through if I even liked the Hero, but love the female lead.  All will be explained (somewhat) in the end...... or is it?","A real mystery story, lots of supes, true love and bad guys (if you tell them from the good guys)"
1671,"My first thought,""How can anyone possibly write a gripping story about the climate change"" now thatI have tturned the last page I can tell you it's worth a read. Its fast paced enough to keep your attention, and has enough twists, and turns for even the most daring of thrill seekers.

It does refer to the Microsoft website a lot, which is frustrating in a hard copy book (one can't be too far away from a connected device). It spends a lot of time on nomenclature, which is fine, but is more of a primer and not ""mastery.""

This is turning out to be an other GREAT SERIES.,Mermaid Moon started out way better than book one The Inn At Ocean's Edge
1677,"Not exactly remarkable, but full of intensely realistic views into a child's head from 1st to 6th grade--a child who is different, sometimes in a likable way, sometimes less understandably. Spinelli is an artist in the way he weaves together words, not in the overwhelming, forced, or boring style of some authors, but in occasional, beautiful descriptions of scenery, setting, and character decision-making.  This is a great read-aloud book, if only for the purpose of thinking about and discussing differences and individual worth.  Not everything is resolved by the end, but such is also life.","Quick, sweet read for reminiscing adults and learning children"
1678,"Gorgeous vampire heroes, nasty baddies and brave feisty heroines, just what the doctor ordered.

1679,"Terry Pratchett is without question my favorite author, and the Discworld series is without compare, except for The Wee Free Men series which is equally as good, and sometimes even deeper.

All in all I really wanted to like this book. I completely hated it. Every moment of reading it. Each of the characters were awful people who made poor decisions time and time again. I kept reading because I thought it HAD to get better. But it certainly did not.

1690,This was a very clear depiction of the time.

Perhaps I read a post on Jill's blog at some time, but her blog, One Good Thing, was definitely not in my Feedly list.  I ordered the book on a whim and it was a very pleasant surprise. The title is apt as she truly does share her tips, her wisdom, and her story. I did not expect this to be a book I would want to take a highlighter to, but it turned out to be just that.

I have no idea why one of the best universities in the country asked an entire YEAR of students to read this piece of junk. They had ""required"" workshops on the class that almost no one went to because almost no one read the book because everyone thought it was trash.

But when well over half of the book is left because the short story is just a cover-up to try to sell some other books, I get annoyed.
The previews of the other books were each longer than the short story.
I would not recommend this book, as that is as sneaky and underhanded as a cliffhanger.",The book is a very short story and  very long previews of other books

1697,"A great read!  I was amazed to learn a great deal about the development of flying that I never read about in my education and/or understood or knew about these two interesting brothers.  I strongly recommend that you consider reading this well written book to inform yourself about what I think is not well known by the general public and how flying, that we take for granted today, got started and evolved in the beginning of flight.",Interesting things you didn't know and never suspected about mans first flight(s).
1698,"Ugh...  The book jumps back and forth between entertaining/exciting and boring/slow.  The Author spends a lot of time over describing things which kept pulling me out of the story.  He does, however, do an amazing job of creating stories of rabbit lore.  Many times I thought the stories the rabbits were telling were even better than the book.  He could have written a whole novel about the characters from the rabbit lore.  I don't regret reading this book, but I could have skipped it and been okay with that.",If you can get half way through then it actually gets pretty good.
1699,"This is the 2nd best book of Dr. Stuart Scott. The best is yet ""Pride and Humility."" But if you have any anger, anxiety, and fear problem, I highly recommend this booklet(since it's so compact, only about 32 pages and thin, it's more like booklet). These series of his gives you highlights of each issue corresponding to Bible. It's such a great reference to bible study, spiritual counseling or just a great conversation topic!","A compact highlight of Bible regarding Anger, Anxiety, and Fear!"
1700,"Even though we kind of know the plot (after 13 books in the series), these books provide a wonderful reading experience.  I enjoy how Mr. Dahners made Zage such a large part of this book; very interesting and entertaining.  I also thoroughly enjoy the ""science"" questions that these stories pose.  Great job!  I just hope that there are many more of these in the future.",Another great book in the series and another great science question.
1701,"A thoughtful and colorful book that documents, interprets, and re-directs a form of urban visual expression at least as old as Pompey.  (Except that they did not have the benefit of spray paint in aerosol cans.) Glad the author points out that it is illegal to graffiti in public places.  (Not at all sure that has yet deterred anyone.) If it was not for the vandalism of rail cars, buildings and highway overpasses, there would be no body of work to talk about.  The book is a tool for encouraging a responsible refinement of the craft.","How to (not) Graffiti Rail Cars, Highway Overpasses, and Other Things That Don't Belong to You"

I decided to look for another copy, because I wanted to brush up on my italic hand, and this is THE book for learning an easy to use and very readable italic hand.  I have totally given up on ""longhand"" and use this version of italic daily (except when I am using my keyboards).

1703,"This book kept me awake nights.  It's hard to read some parts, but worth it.  Found myself wondering about how fragile life can be.

The most phenomenal thing about Flanagan, though, is his talent as a writer.  He is so gifted, the writing almost interfered with enjoyment of the story.  Time after time, a phrase just (literally, not exaggerating) made me gasp.  I found myself re-reading passages just to observe their construction.  Flanagan is a master of a new way to say something profound.","Poetic, breath-taking prose -- If you love language, you must read this book"

1707,"Wunderkeys is a FANTASTIC method to introduce preschoolers to music.  It truly does give them a head start in music and math.  The pages are full of color and appealing to look at.  The activities are simple, engaging, and fun.  The at-home parent guide is easy to follow even for non-musical parents.  The cartoon characters are fun and relatable.

The book reminded me of all of the books by some great writers like DeMille, Follett, Baldacci, Grisham and Clancy.  I am really looking forward to a sequal which I think should be in the works.  Unique storyline that took me back to some of the old time writiers who had that ability to keep you glued to the pages from the beginning to the end, sort of like listening to old time radio shows that always demanded your attention.  Excellent work here.",I think that Michael McGowan has a fantastic future in the writing world
1709,Tuesdays at six by KJ Lewis is my favorite read of 2018 so far. Loved the way it was written from Walts view. The romance between Walt and Sam is beautiful.

If you enjoy a mixture of technical explanations mixed with practical experience this book is for you.  This is NOT a novel, it's a non-fiction view on how our brain works when we are stressed.

Amazingly enough, the explanations for the technology are still current, even though the book was written 7 years before the first satellite was ever launched into space - Heinlein even included the importance of keeping mass to a minimum, as well as the plastic bags for eating and drinking out of in space.

Further the writing on this book just wasn't as taunt as the other and the interaction between Domi and Nate deteriorated to something resembeling a middle school angsty romance.

Where other theory books muddy the explanation this book makes it clear and simple. The use of diagrams, and the piano roll is very helpful.

So overall, this story is a deception. But at the same time, it's a real pleasure to find back all the characters and this universe. So it's still a good way to wait for an hypothetic new movie/season.","Weaker than the TV serial and the movie, but still a pleasure."

I think the premise of the book is interesting- the hunt for the Grail. But, my problem was the execution. The dialog was a bit formulaic and robotic, character development was minimal and the ending was simply a dud versus the climax I was hoping for. With all of that being said, it was an ok read but far below what it could have been.",I realize this book has excellent ratings so my 3 stars may seem odd
1760,"Even a guy like myself was able to enjoy and laugh at the comedy in this.  I'm way, way too old to be a fan of this new adult genre, but a good story is a good story, and that's what this book offers.  Hey, it even makes me feel young again and that's no mean accomplishment.  Sure, this romance is meant for woman readers, but open minded guys reading this review should give the book a try.

As far as young romance fans are concerned, this is a no-brainer.  It's a book you'll likely love and will be anxious to read number 2 in the series whenever it appears.  Read and enjoy the experience.",Fun not only for new adults but for anyone enjoying light romantic comedy
1761,"I found the ties to the Kennedy family to the crime family sad but not unexpected.  The ties to the CIA & the FBI again was not unexpected but very disturbing.  Until I read ""Double Cross"" I had my suppositions about the death of both The president and his brother, the book confirmed many of my own thoughts and perhaps I would rather have not known.  Still we the people needed to know though it made me very sad.",... ties to the Kennedy family to the crime family sad but not unexpected
1762,"It is a solid math practice book with excellent explanations but it does not replace a textbook. It is a good practice book for extra assignments, would not recommend as the primary source.

This also has only multiple choice questions; it is part 1 of a set.",It is a solid math practice book with excellent explanations but it does not replace a textbook
1763,"Through most of the first half of the book, there are pretty long descriptive narratives about each player, much like a James Michener book.  When it finally comes together it moves fast and is not something you want to put down.  One of King's best (I have read many).  I just hope the movie does it justice.",there are pretty long descriptive narratives about each player
1764,"Dr. Mark Bourrie is a very good author. In Volume 11 of the Crimes Canada series Mark writes about Peter Woodcock, a young serial killer from the 1950s. Peter was an evil, twisted and sadistic killer of young children. He was sent to mental institutions instead of prison because it was believed he was insane. I don't believe so myself. He got a slap on the wrist compared to what the children he murdered got, they were killed and molested. This book is a fast paced true crime thriller. It will completely captivate you from the beginning to the end. I'd recommend this to any true crime fan.",A Look Into The Life Of Peter Woodcock-1950s Serial Killer. You Will Love It.
1765,"Having lived in Rome for 25 years, and having paid a lot of attention to food the whole time, I was prepared to be underwhelmed by this cookbook. To my surprise and delight, Parla holds up to the hype. With recipes that ring true to someone who knows, gorgeous photos, and really interesting food commentary, this is a book that makes both a great addition to a Italian cuisine-loving library and a great gift to any Rome-aphile. Brava. Anzi, bravissima!","from someone who knows, Parla holds up to the hype (fab recipes, great photos, and interesting history)"
1766,"Enjoying this book quite a bit.  I can't give any book of this type 5 stars compared to great literature so others may think that is unfair.  Still, I would recommend it.

One aspect that I wish was present was a greater general introduction section describing better the aim and content of the companion to put it into perspective.  I have the 4 volumes of the All-Star companions and the Hawkman companion, all of which I believe are slightly better.  There just may be too much to the Superman mythos to cover in a single volume.",I can't give any book of this type 5 stars compared to great literature so others may think that is unfair

1768,"''Submergence'' is a what I call a highbrow cli fi novel about the ocean, human beliefs and climate change. With its passages about overfishing, acidification and global warming, it's an important book for the times we live in, even if, as the book argues itself, all might be an illusion and while nothing matters and we go on thinking we do matter, maybe in the end nothing matters, even this book. But I refuse to believe this, even if I am under the delusion that we matter.","A powerful cli fi novel about overfishing, acidification and climate change"
1769,"If you liked Pride and Prejudice this is a five star book.  If you didn't, you will find yourself skipping to the end (which I did).

It is Pride and Prejudice in an England inhabited by Dragons.  Fire breathing, gold hoarding, eat each other and perfectly civilized dragons.  With Catholic and Episcopal churches for Dragons.

It is completely true to the style, the pacing, the plotting of Pride and Prejudice without cloning the book.  I found myself admiring the book, even if I had to skip to the end in order to finish it.","Not Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, but Pride and Prejudice and Dragons"
1770,"Two generations beautifully interwoven into a contemporary historical novel that borders on a thriller/mystery. Excellent character development, plotting, twists, everything the reader needs to never leave her/his chair until the epilogue ends! The setting in a 1929 mental asylum juxtaposed to a modern day foster care placement reveals a heartbreaking, but fascinating, side of America, then and now. No spoiler alert, but the ending is wholly satisfying.",Superb glimpse of history juxtaposed with modern drama - enlightening!

I was the first person to check this New book out of our library and I lost it, They should have paid me for loosing it. And they wanted $28. to replace it plus $5. to process it.

It's an imaginative story, the characters are interesting, and there are some surprises.  There is some violence, but it's not the main focus.  The story is.","because it's one of Stephen King's best, and it's not even a scary novel"
1776,"Loved the peek into Scottish life. Sloane and Galen were fun to follow on their romantic adventures and verbal love sparring matches.  Sloane's American friends and Galen's friends and family added to the feeling of a loving and caring community. Please ditch the ""f"" word. It is absolutely not needed or appreciated. That was very why it is rated a three star instead of a four star.","Sweet good romance, if you can ignore the ""way too many"" attempts to raunchy it up with the ""f"" word."
1777,I can't say how much I appreciate this well written and researched work. What it means to the world if in fact Herr Hitler was permitted his 'retirement' instead of punishment should be a wake up call to us all. I do recommend the DVD (same name) by Gerald Williams as a companion to the book. It doesn't really matter if you read the book first or watch the movie first. In fact I recommend to start reading and watch the movie several times to visually see what is being conveyed and portrayed.,Best investigative work on the Hitler's escape from punishment

1780,"A fine writing style.
Being a dog lover and being owned by two dogs myself, Kava's themes and characters  struck a special note with me.  The principal protagonist, Ryder Creed, is a big ex-Marine with Afghanistan service, reminding one of Brad Thor's Scot Harvath or Lee Child's Jack Reacher.  Unlike Reacher, Creed works with a comely & capable FBI agent, Magie O'Dell.  Tales filled in with Magie O'Dell.

1786,This is a well written autobiographical account of the author's young adult life and his WW2 military experience. The book provides many interesting details about B17 Superfortress bombers and the missions that he flew. The book is interesting but is presented in a a rather matter-of-fact manner that lacks the excitement and compelling storylines that are common in many other books of this genre.,Nice autobiographical account of the author's young adult life and WW2 experience.

Jera is the drummer of an up and coming band and Jacob is her 'paperboy'.  They meet when he mistakenly breaks her window when delivering her paper.  She's been unlucky at sex and has lot of insecurities.  Jacob is so sweet and caring and boosts her ego.  A sweet YA romance with a musical theme.

The Catholic/Canon laws instituted by the Pope et al and the Catholic church was appalling and painful to read. However, this is a true story with serious research and insight into the power of the church at that time. It is a powerful read.

I am glad I did.  I think those interested in western literature or aesthetics will find Poetic's to be an essential read as it provides the initial codification of concepts such as tragedy, comedy, plot, unity, character, and katharsis.

Older busybody women who run the town and everyone in it. Some funny parts with some predictable parts.  A few times I was scratching my head as the heroine did/said/thought some things which were out of character for who she was supposed to be.

The autor is a strong man, and went through a lot yet some of his own thoughts and words come across and something you whould expect from the Dali Lama.  A very smart caring man and yet did his exceptial best in a war inviroment.  What a great person he truely is.","I think this book would make a better movie the """"American Snyper"""
1823,"""Gone to Ground"" by Marie Jalowicz-Simon is the story of one brave woman's decision to survive underground as a Jew in Nazi Germany, and how she survived being hunted and identified as a Jew.  Instead of looking at the larger picture of the repression and murder of Jews, which has been done in countless other books, the author tells of her daily struggles for food, shelter, and safety--a view that has rarely been told.  The author is honest about her actions, and makes no apologies for what she did to survive--which is very admirable.  This is a fascinating book.",a decision to survive by any means--told by a very brave woman
1824,"Disclaimer:  I am not a historian.  However, I do read about 30 history books a year, so I might be what you call a history nerd.

I found the book completely adequate in explaining the Punic wars.  He told me everything that I desired to know and then some.  I can now say that I have a grasp on what they were all about and why they are important in the history of the world.

I did find the book to be a little too academic.  Maybe a little dry.  Unless you are really into this sort of thing, I might recommend something a little more simple.","Excellent research.  This book will answer all your questions.  However, a little dry."
1825,"This was such a cute story to read. Gianna wants to learn more and decides to join the history club to learn more about her ancestors. I love Genealogy and I really thought this story was right on the mark, a great beginning book to get children interested in learning where they are from and the history of where they are from. I thought the book was well written and of course makes me want to work more on my own family history. I give this book 5 stars.

This book was provided to me for an honest review and This is a great book for kids.",Great starter book to get kids interested in their family history
1826,As an Indie Author I have noticed that what worked for me a year ago is no longer working and sales have dropped.  I picked up this book and read it in one setting while making notes of the things I will be trying very soon.  I have read several titles in this series and find them useful in bettering my writing. The author sharing her experiences and what's worked and not worked for her have led to me becoming a better writer.  I don't follow every single thing but I have found that adapting them has worked for me.,I have read several titles in this series and find them useful in bettering my writing
1827,"The publisher's description and reviews neglect to mention that all of the stories in this collection have been abridged. The only reason I didn't give this book fewer stars is because I like the watercolored illustrations (which goes to show that not all changes are bad), and because Paddington is still enjoyable reading, even when edited down. I just wish they had published a color edition of the INTACT stories, or at the very least they should have made it clear upfront that entire chapters have been omitted.",This is NOT a comprehensive collection of the Paddington stories!
1828,"Loved this read review of delicious and it mention it was the sequel to this  so I had to read them  making this the fourth book of hers I've read this month now I move onto delicious I love that she shines a spot light on her characters  insecurities and short  comings and proceeds ver deliberately dismantles them logically as the story unfolds I like her slow purposeful manner of developing relationships

1829,"Kendra Donovan, a modern-day FBI agent, is somehow catapulted 200 years back in time.  She emerges in the same structure but 2 centuries ago, finding an estate grappling with a vicious serial killer.  She must somehow help solve the crime without the technology to which she is accustomed.  Does she do it?  And if so, how?  Read this worthwhile book and find out!","The author has put a new, fresh spin on the time travel theme.  I can hardly wait for the next series entry!"
1830,"I love a good mystery but this wasn't really my cup of tea. Two young girls - one was murdered; one abandoned her baby. Keeping the characters and plots separate was hard and confusing. Also, the fawning, accepting references to the Christian religion were hard to get by, but really any religious deference in a book is not something that appeals to me. I knew the heroine was a minister's wife (and I've known many who were very interesting) , but I thought I'd try the book anyway, But after reading this author's style, I won't try another book written by her.",Two plots and too many characters were confusing; religious references were turn-off
1831,"You have to have an open mind when reading this as it's pretty far out even for those of us who really have done it all.
Original, great character development. This is what I tell reviewers when I get steamed about them rating junk 5 stars. Definitely for mature people and may offend the very religious although it is not anti religious in any way. Heinleins take on his main characters religion is what may offend those more narrow minded although it is all about love.","Although I'm not a huge Heinlein fan this and ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistriss"" are must reads"
1832,"It's interesting that some reviewers have dinged this book for the ultra-alpha hero. To me it worked perfectly, because while he is completely over-the-top alpha, it's in the context of being completely respectful of the heroine's needs. He says ""I'm going crazy!"" but doesn't let any of that bleed into control of the heroine's decisions, her life choices, or anything, really. It's a hard balance to find and Bailey does a great job of it.",It's a hard balance to find and Bailey does a great job of it
1833,"Good read, lots of twists and turns. Along with the crime you have the saga of what's going on in everyone's lives- these people grew up together, get married, travel to and fro but end up in this little town where everyone knows everyone. When people start dying the accusations start flying so hold on to your seats and watch old passions simmer, evil blossom and tongues wag as you try to figure out this who done it!!!!!! Good read!","Long lost loves face off, town gossips are busy and bodies turn up dead- good ingredients for an interesting read!"
1834,"Deborah Smith's ""The Crossroads Cafe"" was a pleasant change from the 'heavier' books I've read lately.  Without boinking you on the head, she leads you to a lesson of the true beauty of a person which is not on the outside (visual part), but deep inside.  Also, a person's way of treating others with love and kindness, making the reader a believer in ""beauty's only skin deep"", and ""it's what's inside a person that counts.""  Although it was easy to guess the happily ever after ending, you won't be disappointed with it.","a pleasant change from some of the ""heavier"" books I've read lately."
1835,"I read this book with my 10 year old daughter.  She looked forward to each day when we would sit together and see what Elle was in for next.

1836,"Nowadays it is difficult to ignore the power of social media.
In his book,Richard explains the importance of Facebook with over 1.2 billion active users.
You will also learn the importance of Twitter and YouTube.

1838,I couldn't put this book down. (Actually downloaded ony Kindle) I highly recommend this book. Skip Heitzig is an amazing author. He brought Revelation alive. Revelation is the one book of the Bible. I've stayed away from because I felt it was so hard to understand. I suggest you open your Bible to the book of Revelation and Skips book and read th together.  Revelation is my new favorite book. Each time I read it God opens my mind to something new.,Anyone can understand the book of Revelation is the perfect title!'
1839,"I really like the personal perspective from which this book is written, yet the author does not overstate his success, in fact there is a practical honesty and genuineness that is I appreciate very much. The principles are listed very succinctly,band there is an air of 'do-able ness' that permeates the entire book. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels like they are in a meaningless, rat race in life as this book points to the focus of what the rhythm of life is all about.","very practical, easy to read principles that one can think about and identify with."
1840,"Every great story begins with the answers to the questions Eddie Jones provides in A Novel Idea. Don't believe the old adage that ""great writing can't be taught."" It can and this book is the perfect place to begin your education! New writers will find a solid foundation here and experienced writers will return to this book whenever they find themselves lost in the very world they've created. Here is the lens to see the forest through the trees. A must have book for every writer's library!",Questions Every Writer Asks at the Start of Every Great Story
1841,"If you want a guaranteed way of burning out in ministry leadership, follow this book's advice. Sanders does make some good suggestions and points here and there, but this book is more fitting as a ""be all you can be"" poster that sets up a heroic (and unrealistic) picture of what leadership is about rather than a ""thriving in and through ministry"" which is what those in ministry leadership actually need. For that, I'd recommend Strengthening the Soul of Your Leadership by Ruth Haley Barton.",Sanders does make some good suggestions and points here and there
1842,"A Trip to the Hardware Store & Other Calamities is a collection of short essays of life's observations that are very reminiscent of Erma Bombeck.  All of the stories were well written and moving ~ some of them were extremely funny.

Carrie Lee Martz did a great job narrating and contributed to my enjoyment of this short audio book.

At almost one hour, it's the perfect length for my commute to and from work. I can't wait to listen to Barbara Venkataraman's next collection of short essays!",Great collection of life's observation reminiscent of Erma Bombeck!
1843,"The flow of the book and the stories make learning fun and engaging. I like how the author includes definitions of specific phrases along with the story. The structure of the stories adds a twist to the basic English-French translation dictionaries. The stories are centered on everyday life and I catch myself speaking random phrases throughout the day. Very useful for my beginners after they get their feet wet with some grammar. That being said, it is very useful once they know pronunciation. They can get the meaning of the story without knowing every single word.",... flow of the book and the stories make learning fun and engaging
1844,"I really enjoyed the ease of Comey's writing. Initially I thought there would be a lot of political and legal jargon I wouldn't understand, but this was not the case. He writes for the every man. I really enjoyed the personal anecdotes he added and the family stories as well. You learn a lot about Comey the man as well as Comey the husband and father, Comey the lawyer, and Comey as a real person.
Yes, he touches on Trump, as well as other presidents and celebrities alike. It's a great work of non-fiction and if he wrote another I would surely read that as well.","Intelligent, Informative, and Enjoyable - Couldn't put it down"
1845,"I have to say, I was skeptical.  How many other literary franchises have disintegrated when handed off to other authors?  Not so in this case.

Possibly the most telling thing I can say about the first Lagercrantz-penned novel in this series is this: Weeks after finishing it, I keep finding myself longing for the next story!  The book was a real page-turner, suspenseful, and very enjoyable.  I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original trilogy, and I hope we'll see another from Lagercrantz soon.",I absolutely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the original trilogy
1846,"The novel kept me guessing who the assassin is from beginning to end, it is a long book but I never felt bored or too long. I have read every single book wrote by Isabel Allende and I was a bit sceptic about it because it was a crime book and she had never written something similar but it was great, very well formed and with a good and believable ending.",Isabel Allende moves away from her safe zone but she does it well
1847,"Excellent book.  The graphic novel format is a truly great way to impart this story, which is a tale about the end of life that all families will go through.  Somehow the cartoons seem to lighten up what could be a really depressing and sad story.  We so enjoyed the book that we bought copies for all our relatives.  It's that kind of a book.a must read for everyone!",The best realistic book on the subject of aging and the end of life.a must read for all families!
1848,"A very entertaining children's book about lawnmowers and toys! There are many different lawnmowers all with different sounds and personalities. A little bouncy ball gets stuck and calls for help. Each different lawnmower is asked to help and all refuse but one. But he is not the most powerful, so can he do it? Love the illustrations and various personalities on the toys and lawnmowers. A sure hit with children that love machines and toys!",Great children's book that bring lawnmowers and toys to life!
1849,"The author describes details of the beginnings of supersonic and hypersonic research and facilities that are not easily found in one resource. Also, the first person I have heard or read that testifies that von Braun was NOT a Nazi....based on first person friendship with him. Also a great perspective on the war from the German side.",This book is a must read for Aerospace Engineers and WWII enthusiasts.
1850,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of yogic philosophy and practice.  It is written in a manner that is very accessible and entertaining and I  would recommend this work to all who are interested in adding to their understanding of where and how yogic thought originated and evolved into what we practice presently.  I am very grateful to Amy as, through her diligent research and creative documentation, I have found an accurate and entertaining resource to add to my own spiritual evolution and exploration.  With warmest Namaste, Amy.",I thoroughly enjoyed reading this history of yogic philosophy and practice
1851,"Poorly bound. The edges of the pages weren't even. Low quality paper. The cover and spine were cheap looking.  It looked like a book club or library edition. I bought it for a gift for my daughter, but it was such low quality I couldn't give it to her. I kept it and found a much better quality edition for her.",Good enough for a young child to read and abuse. Not a quality product.
1852,"Really glad to have found this again. i bought and read it when it first came out and Candice Bergen had not yet had the 2nd half of her life. even then I thought it a cut above the usual celebrity bio, due to the good writing and the lack of poor pitiful rich me. It's a treat to read more than 25 years later...hoping for a part 2 someday.",I have been looking for this book since I gave my hardcover copy away in the early 90s
1853,"Author's attempt to make this read like an investigation written in 1910 or so, gets in the way of the story. Her essays on claimed methodology of the investigation are best skimmed over.

It does appear as if Oates is attempting to demonstrate her supple skill at writing different styles in the same novel. The essays are hardly persuasive.",Author's attempt to make this read like an investigation written in 1910 or so
1854,"I love anything Christina Lauren writes and this was no exception. While this book was very different from their others, I think it fit the characters and their situation wonderfully. You have to write for the characters and what they're going through, not just pander to what you think the audience wants. It has to move the characters and plot line forward, and it did in a great way. I can't wait for Christina Lauren's next release!",I love anything Christina Lauren writes and this was no exception
1855,"First of all, we are Duck Dynasty fans. The Robertson family has entertained and encouraged us for years with their shenanigans and faith. We first picked up a title from this series for the kids to try out on their Fire tablets.

Our (at the time) reluctant reader enjoyed the story so much, we ended up purchasing the entire box set. Thanks to the choose your own story format, the kids can read them over and over and have a different adventure each time.",Great set for reluctant readers and kids who like to read stories over and over again
1856,"I loved that the acronyms and jargon were well addressed and so many links listed were relevant yet I did not feel that I was being ""talked down to"" .  I would buy this book again for a friend or relative with no experience Blogging to get them off and running. Other Blogging ""help"" books are still awaiting a read on my bookshelf.","Such a relevant book.  I got so excited, I jumped ahead of my target dates!"
1857,"WOW! What a great new author! Excellent medieval romance! A story in which love conquers all, even the most wounded of hearts. I won't rehash the plot as others have already done, but I tell you this -if you liked Garwood and McGreggor books, you'll love this one too. Quinn is maybe not as polished as a seasoned writer, but that won't keep you from getting enthralled by the story. Definitely one sitting! The main characters are excellent as well as the extras. I absolutely loved the Duke of Normandy -William (future King), he was hilarious. Plenty of love scenes and humor in this one. Get it!",Saxon Lady Mends The Norman Knights Heart  -Excellent Period Romance
1858,"Audio version: the narrator of this book completely ruins it. His phrasing etc often entirely changes the meaning of the text. Seriously, I've heard 12year old library volunteers do a better job reading a book they have never seen before. If I were Brandon Mull I would get this thing re-recorded ASAP. The awful audio treatment gives the book a bad name.","I thought I had heard the world's worst narration, but I was wrong"
1859,I thought some bits were over dramatized as if the book was written by a teenager but it is very revealing. The bits on Andurand's journey to immense wealth is quite revealing about the nature of this high pressure business. The piece of Delta's chief hedger is great too. If you wan't to know what the business of commodity trading (financial hedging/speculating) is like this is a great read. I just wish it covered physical trading which it did not.,Great account of financial traders but not much on physical traders
1860,"Hallowed Halls by Hannah Alexander is a great story with an intriguing concept, believable and fascinating characters and loads of suspense and romance, making it a hard book to put down. I've read Hannah Alexander's books before but in my opinion this is her best. A great writer and a great story. What more could you want. This one's a keeper",Hallowed Halls by Hannah Alexander is a great story with an intriguing concept
1861,"This is a sit on the edge of your seat sequel written beautifully and powerfully. Although a book two, the story never falters and the reader is caught up in the transformation of Temujin into Genghis Khan. The complex family interactions between the brothers is well handled as well as the delicate juggling Temujin must manage between the tribes, his generals, and his own brothers.  Loved it--but read the first book first, Temujin growth and reactions to his world and status will make more sense.",... sit on the edge of your seat sequel written beautifully and powerfully
1862,Ive read about 40 different books on health and healing the digestive system. I could have totally skipped all of them if I started with this. They covered eveything and made it easy to understand especially with the use of metaphores. This is what eating healthy truly is. My leaky gut is healed and I know this because my chronic acne is gone! Plants.,They covered eveything and made it easy to understand especially with the use of metaphores
1863,"Funny, thoughtful, and at least 10% true (at least Megan Mullally's story) Kathy once again delivers all of the celebrity stories you crave. It's clear she's no longer on the D-List (intimate dinners with Woody Allen, Gloria Steinem, et. al.), but she still occasionally gets star-struck. It's a quick and breezy read, but costs less than a live performance and contains almost completely new material never covered in her many standup specials. She clearly knows how to spin a yarn, and has a wicked memory",Just like Proust but without the cookie...Kathy never forgets
1864,Got it at the library some of her comedy is alright thats why i checked it out but this was garbage slammed between pages. She has really gone downhill since the ghostbusters movie and this was like walking off a cliff for her so self absorbed she doesnt understand the struggles of us poor people. On a side note she could always do chubby fetish if she needs the money i would buy that,Trashed smashed into pages so fresh you can still smell bad eggs
1865,"After enjoying the first 2 books in this series, Passing Through Perfect fell a bit flat for me. I could never really get into the characters and kept wondering when this story would link together with the first two books. I loved the characters in the previous books but they were just cameos in Passing Through Perfect.",A bit of a disappointing end to what started as a great trilogy
1866,Easy read - I enjoyed it.  It is not a book that I feel I would like to call all my friends and tell them they must read it - and it certainly does not hold you riveted to it (i.e. a page turner) but it was a nice break from my usual reading.  And the book moves along.  The characters he meets along his journey are well introduced and described without going on ad nauseum.  His journey moves on each day and so do the places and the people he meets.,I would recommend this book for an interesting quick and easy read
1867,"It starts off as an interesting, realistic WWII thriller but soon dissolves into a ridiculous farce built around the arrogance and  exploits of Col. whats-his-name, any one of which could have ended in disaster.  Yeh, the story ends with only one prisoner killed, one redeemed to his self esteem and a couple hundred rescued. But the takeover of the train and killing 21 armed guards on top of a moving train in dead of winter stretches credulity for me. The whole thing was a great disapointment",Like a lot of books it seems to go off into squirley country toward the end.
1868,This book was fascinating!  Anyone who enjoys nature and discovering new things about wolves will enjoy this one.  Shaun Ellis gave up much experience with the animals and their environs in this book.  He actually lived with them in the wild and studied with Native Americans to learn to introduce them into the wild and become one of them for long periods of time.  He left civilization to engage in their very activity and learn to howl with them.  I highly recommend this book to any nature lover.,Anyone who enjoys nature and discovering new things about wolves will enjoy this one
1869,"A promising but disappointing series. This is too much of a Harry Potter rip-off to satisfy a well-read reader of YA fantasy. It's as though the author diagrammed all of Rowling's books, and made sure that she (Goodman) had equivalent plot points and even equivalent characters in her own book.  This struck me as a gross lack of imagination, and I felt, while reading all three books, that none of the characters ever came truly to life.  That's because they weren't truly imagined. They were borrowed.",Too much of a Harry Potter rip-off to satisfy a well-read reader of YA fantasy
1870,"I tell ya...this is my kinda girl.  I loved loved this story.  The spunk and quick wit in both this story and Saturday Woodcutter is amazing to me.  Well told and thought out, it puts her and the hero into extraordinary circumstances to both come together and to escape together...but places the mantle of hero in her hands.  Brains and brawn become equal partners and the crafty way these are blended together leave you wanting to stay up longer to find out how the next puzzle is solved.  Saturday Woodcutter is a hero for the ages!",Best title for this book. A hero among books and among fairytale characters!
1871,"I bought this book at the request of a family member who doesn't have an Amazon acct.  the topic really didn't interest me and the book was shipped directly to that person.  He has not provided a review. I just responded to Amazons 3rd request for a review so they will stop bugging me.

1872,"I was getting tired of the same old story lines in zombie fiction and then I happened on this book.  A fresh take, great story, well-developed characters and more twists and turns than the world's largest pretzel.  Downloaded and read it straight through, could not put it down (for long).  I can't wait for Book 2!","Zombie Fiction was getting repititious - WOW, this was great!"
1873,"This is a stunning book. Our 2.5 year-old loves it (it's far too long and complicated to read word-for-word) even as we pick and choose different elements to read from each page. As a result of reading Locomotive, she's developed a keen sense for pointing out older buildings and traditional forms of transportation. Although we imagine she'll enjoy the book even more when she's older, it's more than captivated her at an early age. Such a fabulous book this is!",Although we imagine she'll enjoy the book even more when she's older
1874,"I really enjoyed meeting Scarlet and discovering the Old World in which she lives and works. Very interesting, fresh twist on the ever popular Vampire-Werewolf-Witch books. I liked Scarlet's character as she's a bit damaged and you see her working her way through some of the ""push people away so they don't get to close"" wall  she has built as a result of her parents dying when she was a teenager. Just enough romanctic cliff hanger to keep me coming back to read the next book Trail of Dead, which was equally good.",Exciting new series with a similiar feel to Mercy Thompson series
1875,"I laughed so much from the beginning through the end of this book. He explained a lot about his religion and then his experiences within the Christian's. This is one of my favorite all time reads. Human's are strange creatures....and when you mix in religious traditions.....things do get a bit over the top as he pointed out. I plan to re- read this book, because I enjoyed it so much.",One of my all time favorite reads. I appreciate his honesty and wittiness! So funny....so true!
1876,"Well-written, well researched. Osman believes Joseph and Yuya were the same person; and Moses and Akhenaten. Very convincing. Worth the read if you've been curious about the parallel histories of Egypt and the beginnings of the formation of the tribes which called themselves the children of Israel (Jacob).",A well-written look into the beginnings of the children of Israel in the land of Egypt
1877,"Batton Lash, the author of ""Supernatural Law"" series is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!  The artwork is, well, art.  The characters are well thought out and drawn with subtle variations of style that fit each one.  The stories hold your attention and the word play is enough to delight the most discerning reader as well as anyone looking for a giggle.  I rated this book as ""No violence"", unless you consider someone being transformed by magic as ""violence.""  It is a shame you can only give this five stars.  It should be more like fifteen stars.","the author of ""Supernatural Law"" series is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!"
1878,"So much potential for a really great story, but the ending was confusing, disappointing. and went no where.  I am left feeling that somehow the whole book didn't make it to my kindle. I ""get"" the message of the book but there are so many more  worthier reads.  Enders Game is a good one; it had a beginning, middle and ending. How about 1984 or Animal Farm. In the end this books just didn't have enough depth or mental challenge for me.  Granted I'm in my 70's and not 12 so maybe that's the problem.","So much potential for a really great story, but the ending was confusing"
1879,"This book is awesome! The hand drawn illustrations are very well done. It has a simple format which is great for kids, a white page with the picture and letter. Too much clutter on the page, as I've seen in many other books, makes it difficult to focus on the letter being taught. And the letter/picture combinations are simple for a small children first learning their letters. It's full of things that all little boys love...things with wheels!! My son loves it! I highly recommend.",This book is awesome! The hand drawn illustrations are very well done
1880,"I had bought this book for my new kindle because it was free and I am very happy that I did. I have proudly added Barbara Freethy to my list of most favorite authors.  It was very easy to get involved with this story & the characters from the beginning. I have already put several other books on my ""wish list"".",so glad it was free for the Kindle so I was introduced to such an amazing author
1881,I loved this couple individually and together they are irresistible. They fit perfectly from the moment they met. They are even best friends which is so endearing.  Loved catching up with Lothaire & Ely again. Ending contains a bit of a cliffhanger about another character that was introduced in Lothaire's book.,Mirceo Daciano and Caspian the Tracker have made the favorite IAD couples list!
1882,"A well-written and engrossing story. The suspense grows from page to page, making the book most difficult to put down. Characters have real depth, and the interactions are quite realistic. The intricacy of the plot is amazing, yet everything fits together so well. I am looking forward to reading more of Clark's books. The level of description is perfect for creating good mental images without detracting from the movement of the story. I recognized most of the LA locations, and I found the descriptions accurate and evocative. This book has my highest recommendation.","The intricacy of the plot is amazing, yet everything fits together so well"
1883,This is the wisest and clearest book written on environmental law I have read. It focuses on the root cause of environmental destruction and shows us that by becoming more earth centric within law (i.e. we are not at the centre of the universe but are part of a greater system that includes the earth) we can integrate human behaviour into the ecosystem and therefore have healthier planet and therefore a healthier humanity since we are part of the whole and not separate form the Earths environment.,The most significant work on envirinmental law written to date
1884,This book gives a lot of powerful insight into our internet personality.  The person we are online is not the person we are out in the world.  It's quite chilling what people are capable of when they can hide behind a computer.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone on any reading level.  I tend to only read fiction but I got through this book quickly because it's SO fascinating.  Jon Ronson takes you on a journey of discovery with him as he studies the reemergence of public shaming and some of the lives it's affected!,I definitely recommend this book to anyone on any reading level
1885,"Let me say first off I enjoyed the book. It was enjoyable to read. The plot kept me interested, I enjoyed seeing the beginning of the characters involved. I would not be opposed to reading the next in the series.

That being said, there is a caveat. If you have read Ilona Andrew's Kate Daniel series you are going to pick up on a lot of...similarities.",Good book but shares a lot of commonalities with Kate Daniel's series...*cough* *cough*
1886,"I was quite disappointed with this book after reading the reviews. If what you are looking for is a treatise on homogenous retirement communities and/or communities for profit, this is your book. If you want to find out whether you will like living in one of these places, forgo the book and spend a week in the community you are considering. The tales are not humorous and they are told in at best a mildly judgmental manner, even when he talks about people he supposedly likes.

1887,"Let's face it: Anything Deb Smith writes is beautifully done. She's a mistress of storytelling, and these characters are my all-time favorites. While I didn't realize that this book is only the next installment in their story, I was hooked from the first page. I will be eagerly awaiting the next installment! Hurry, please??","Beautifully written, compelling continuation of original book"
1888,"I really like the way that Thomas writes, it's always a mix of personal history, in with the topic of the day.

As a published writer on both Kindle and Create Space platforms, I was interested to see what he could add to my knowledge base.

Although there was little on the technical angle, reading through the book has re-motivated me, and readied me for my next writing project.

1889,"Very slow reading and depressing. The book does not seem to go anywhere. Every time I pick it up, I think it is going to develop into something, and it never does. Too long a book, for so little a subject. Too many characters, for no reason, whatsoever. They add nothing to the storyline. I am used to a book I just cannot put down. This one is easy to put down and hard to pick back up. The characters are all disturbed and unlikeable, but this is only one problem. Filling a vacancy, is just not enough of a story line. Too many really good reads out there. Don't waste your time.","too many other good ""reads"" out there. Don't waste your time or your eyestight."
1890,"Honestly, as of now, I haven't finished this book yet, but I'm rating it now because I don't know if or when I will be able to get through all of it. I started reading it over a month ago, and I'm barely at the halfway mark because it's so dull. To get as far as I am, I've had to make it so that it's the only book available to me, and I've still had to skim much of it to stay awake. Needless to say, I'm disappointed.

Maria is so good at explaining how the body functions in relation to what the recipe is/how the ingredients work to your benefit (as well as supplements). I have learned SO much more from Maria's books than any others I have read to date - she is phenomenal! And I love that she has recipes that are easy to make and that allows us items that we are used to eating from before the Keto lifestyle - like her Protein Bread. Pure awesomeness!!",This author is AWESOME  great recipes and explanations on food/supplement benefits
1892,"I received this book and read it in one sitting. It is a compelling story with real characters. The good guys are really good and the bad guys hit the other end of the scale easily. Most SciFi literature requires you to greatly suspend your ""disbelief"" to stay in the story but this one was natural feeling. I very much appreciate Richard Fox's book and would recommend it to you.","A good read with action, romance and intrigue. Hard book to put down."
1893,"The Poisonwood Bible is a story about a Baptist minister who takes his family to the Belgian Congo in 1959.

I usually just rent books, but this one was so wonderful I had to buy it. Read this now!",Not for reading in bed if your SO is trying to sleep. Hilarious!
1895,"Coming Alive is fast paced a romance novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat and just turning the page for just one more chapter before going to be. To me personally, the only downfall to this book is the author wrote it in third person, when it would have flowed better in first (my opinion of course). This book is the first of a series so I am anxiously awaiting the next novel in the Welcome to Carson series.",when it would have flowed better in first (my opinion of course)
1896,"Saving Sailor is such a sweet'feel good' story about one family's summer vacation that it really surprised me that the author created such a nice family,as that is so seldom portrayed today. It really is a delight to read and some wonderful humor as well.

This book is not overly religious,but A.J. does ponder some about God,(what normal 10 year old doesn't)and her thoughts on God's creation of the Daisy is 'milk through your nose' funny,LOL!

1898,"Truth be told, I was hoping for a bit more Cornwellian blood and thunder in The Risen than what I got.  Instead the reader gets an inventive and often fascinating look at the mosaic of slaves and gladiators (and their many beliefs) from all over the Empire who flocked to Spartacus and his revolt.  The author illuminates what's often whitewashed in Hollywood portrayals of Rome- that it was a brutal, pitiless society which enslaved and slaughtered millions and where even high-born women were chattel.",An inventive look back at ancient Rome and those who rose against it

1902,"Well written story with full character development and great story line. Malladi is a talented author and I look forward to more books from her.

The story shows you different sides of the surrogate mother story without going all sappy and righteous.  No one side comes out as the obvious ""winner"", but many sides are explored in an intelligent and often humorous way.  I recommend it

Neither counted on the chemistry between them.,This is a love story between a pragmatic historical biographer and a rock star

Starting with her first Americorps job out of college, she takes the reader through each step of the journey that she and her husband took to achieve their dream of moving to Vermont and living a life of frugal intention.  This would be a great book for anyone wanting to be more mindful about stewarding their financial resources.",One of the Best Personal Finance Books That I have Ever Read!
1906,I have several other books on goats as I raise pure bred Nigerian Dwarf goats.  This is by far the most concise and easy to read book that I own.

1910,"I love anything about ancient texts of the Bible and this book did not disappoint. But it's so much more than that! It's the amazing, rich story of two women, their unusual upbringing, highly entertaining and rambunctious lives (especially considering this is in the 1800's), and their travels to Egypt and Mt. Sinai leading to the discovery of these rare and valuable texts. An inspirational book on many levels!

It's forbidden. Raw. Extremely well written and the characters really do come alive.
I do have to say though, my head was spinning for sure in the beginning (in a good way)!
 I'm very much the intuitive reader, meaning I ""see"" and ""hear"" the characters and the story plays like a movie in my head...so just imagine! Lol

1916,"This is one of those books you can't put down. The story line was predictable and the coincidences a little stretched, but the writing was so good those things didn't matter. Also, I was able to connect because I had done much the same things in London and Tel Aviv. The education about how TV interviews are created was a plus as were the bits on artistic clothing styles and experimental literature.

1925,"John Sandford is a terrific author of crime mysteries and many have a thread of interesting science running through them. This book is far different as its a Sci-Fi book with a thread of crime running though it, and plenty of politics and cynicism- typical of his writing.

For every parent, prospective, parent and educator!"
1932,I found it a bit unrealistic that a couple of teenagers who supposedly had been deeply in love for years never had sex. And then when they did years later it was a bit anti-climactic. Especially since the male character said he hadn't been with a woman in five years. I found myself thinking just do it already because it was ridiculously drawn out.,... couple of teenagers who supposedly had been deeply in love for years never had sex
1933,"These books are fun and easy to read. As a long time sci-fi/fantasy reader, I enjoy an imaginative alternative reality and I like the way this author weaves angels, archangels and vampires into contemporary life with a symbiotic relationship to 'humans.'

At first I thought it was maybe an error, but when I was in a bookstore the other day I noticed that all the books have the exact same marks.

The stories presented in this book were not at all interesting to me so I had no interest in learning/remembering the vocabulary words that were new to me.  On the plus side, I love the way the book is organized.  I especially like the exercises about synonyms and antonyms.

1951,"It was very very hard to get through the last half of the book for a computer science phd, no less!  Total adulation of Shannon and totally unnecessary praise of Bell Labs; with no discussion or insight into the work of Shannon, compared by some, to the work of Isaac Newton.  The only technical part of Shannon's work is one formula in the middle of a page, the rest is all eccentricities of a guy, not so interesting...",Total adulation of Shannon and totally unnecessary praise of Bell Labs
1952,Marla's easy writing style is inviting and her informative chapters will keep you reading.  She provides a great wealth of information for Christians on intercultural marriage.  I know this would be a great book to give to any of your newly wed friends or soon to be wed friends.  Thanks Marla for providing an innovative and much needed resource for couples!,something I wish i would have had in my early years of marriage
1953,"Perhaps the most common question we ask ourselves in this life is, ""why am I here?"" Bill leads the reader through a journey of faith that, at in the end, makes our story one worth telling. However, unlike other books on the subject of faith, Bill's book makes faith easily understandable and applicable. Reading this book will show you how to live a life of significance, and how to live a story worth telling.",Are you looking to live a story of purpose and significance? Read this book!
1954,What can I add that hasn't already been written about The Haunting of Hill House. This book is the standard by which all books about haunted houses are judged. Shirley Jackson's writing is spare and well paced. It leads the reader on a roller coaster ride from the mundane to the horrible in just a few sentences. My only criticism is the characters sometimes react inappropriately to experiences that should send them running for the door and never coming back.,It leads the reader on a roller coaster ride from the mundane to the horrible in just a few sentences
1955,"Amusing and light read. Historical romance is normally not my most favorite genre, but this was fun to read. When it became a bit boring a new twist was introduced.  I'm reading right now the second book of this series, but I think that is it because the main theme repeats itself. Nevertheless, it's like with the first book, when it becomes boring, a new twist is introduced. The writer is talented and good at this genre.","Historical romance is normally not my most favorite genre, but this was fun to read"
1956,"Arthur Gould Lee tells the familiar story and much more He not only tells of fights in the sky with the common concurrences of jammed guns and flying outdated machines, but also of the day to day activities of being a duty officer or ""Orderly Dog"" and getting payroll and all the other things you would not normally hear about from a scout pilot. A very interesting read.",Genuine account of what it was like to be a Fighter Pilot in the World War
1957,"Chelsea has gotten a lot of criticism about advocating the shots causing autism. NOT true. She never advises people to not get inoculations.
SHe asks some very good questions about inoculation schedule that should be asked and answered.
Her experience with her son should not be taken as a hope for every autistic child. Ever case is different and false hope is a not a good idea.
The main take away from her book should be.... Don't accept the first diagnosis. Be a an advocate for your child. Get the correct diagnosis early and do something positive even if you are told it is wrong.",A good start on the search for autism help. Don't take false hope from this book
1958,"I really liked the evolution of Nate...  From man slut to ""Rosie's Bitch"".  Really a fun read.

OMG there are some really funny lines here...  Enjoyed the witty dialog from the start.  And while Nate does start off as a pompous ass, he does get owned by the end.

But he has a deadly serious side as a s.w.a.t sharpshooter; a day a work could mean he's killed a few bad guys.  Who can resist a hero?

Highly recommend.",ROFL depiction of  transition from man whore to Rosie's Bitch.  Very witty in a self deprecating way.
1959,"Tamsen's book makes a great gift for the women you have pissed-off so badly they will likely never speak to you again.  The book will make her smile and she wlil think fondly of you .....for about 20 seconds but without the book she would hunt ya down and cut your nuts off.
Give her/then the book and some flowers and some candy and some wine and some cash and a fur coat and you may....i repeat....may get forgiven.  But wit hthe book, the ladies can do oh, so much better than you (us).","Nice gift that may get you back in her good graces....hah, on second thought just send it anonomyously"
1960,"You cannot miss with Rollins' Sigma Force novels.  They keep you nailed to your seat with excitement.  His invitation to be drawn into the stories he creates is irresistable.  And with each book comes the part that incites the reader to find out more: At the conclusion of each book, is an explanation of the real life events, technology and places represented in the story.  My only regret at the end of each book is that I have to wait for the next one to come out!","Rollins Never fails to Invite, Excite and Incite.  6th Extinction is no exception"
1961,"Wow. This is one gritty, realistic story that comes very close to the bone. The author tells a tale of sex trafficking, drugs and varying degrees of crime. We meet characters on the inside doing time, then meet them on the outside, their lives are spun together and they combine in an almighty plot. The revelations of which had me gripping the edge of my seat and made my heart race. A great deal of suspense and intrigue for sure. Well worth a read if you enjoy contemporary writing with an edge.",Well worth a read if you enjoy contemporary writing with an edge.
1962,The compelling story of the Wright Brothers learning flight. Their  determination in the quest to fly reminds me of Marconi and Roentgen's hard work in discovering radio waves and x Rays.

1964,"Dog Loves Drawing is an imaginative and fun read about Dog who becomes immersed in his sketchbook, stepping into another world as he draws. The illustrations are simple yet adorable. Lousie Yates created three dimensional characters within a one dimensional landscape. This would be a fantastic read aloud to share with your kiddo or a classroom full of them. Children will be racing to grab their own paper and pencils and start creating. Loved it!",Dog Loves Drawing is an imaginative and fun read about Dog who becomes immersed in his sketchbook
1965,"I could hardly wait for this book to become available on Kindle. Oh my -- the wait was sure worth it. Peter May has done it again - created a wonderful tale of intrigue full of fabulously fleshed out characters. The descriptions of the scenery make you feel as if you were there.

1966,The Prime Ministers by Yehuda Avner is a compelling accounting of history as seen through the eyes of the author. It dispels many of the myths and lies told and retold with facts debunking untruths that have become accepted by their frequent rebelling. Anyone who enjoys new insight into major figures like American presidents and English and European world leaders from a personal perspective will appreciate how successive Israeli leaders and their governments impacted on pivotal events that changed the course of world developments.,One man's recounting of a vital historical  chapter of the Middle East History with undeniable documentation

The chemistry was off the charts between the sex toy CEO and the shrink.  I loved Michelle because she was comfortable with her self and was not afraid to put Jack in his place.

1972,"I have read several Patterson Alex Cross books and I have to say this is my least favorite.  I still enjoyed reading it but...it seemed overly complicated to me--not complex--but unnecessarily complicated, as though Patterson was trying hard to fill pages and had to include more than the usual twists and turns.  I will continue to read this series, but perhaps be more mindful of others reviews and ratings.",... and I have to say this is my least favorite. I still enjoyed reading it but
1973,"Another great read by one of my new favorite authors!  While some may find the main character annoying, I love him.  He's smart, but not obnoxious, doesn't take himself too seriously and spins a web that really keeps you guessing on who the bad guys are.  The only bad part of this book is finding that there isn't a Book 4 to dig in to.  Bring Richard Paladin back, please!","Funny, Gripping and makes you fear for your life.  Couldn't put it down!"

1975,"I REALLY enjoyed this book!!  It was (nearly) impossible to tell fact from fiction and that's something I love in a good adventure novel.  That fact that the places are real, and they are truly surrounded by mysteries makes it all the more suspenseful and exciting.  I can visit those places, see the things he's written about, ponder the mysteries on my own.  I'm thrilled to have found this author.  I'm sure Sean Wyatt will be one of my favorite characters as I read through this series.",Wonderful book!!  Fiction with enough truth to it to make it nearly impossible not to enjoy!

Simple and powerful...concise and poetic...a major leap forward in finally moving your abundance ""needle"" forward.

The ROI on this minimal investment is magnificent.",M is for both Magic and its Manifestation in Living Exceptionally!
1977,"Really interesting memoir of a young woman who settled in the Mississippi Delta in the late 1800s. In her own words, this narrative describes her life and the many hardships she and her family went through. Life was so difficult then, but she was strong and tough and optimistic, she worked extremely hard, and she survived until old age. This is a true picture of pioneer life, the early timber camps in the south, and the joys and sorrows and dangers these early settlers lived through.  Very thought provoking!",True account of a female pioneer in Mississippi Delta in 1800s.

And while I enjoyed this book it did lack some of Ms. Sands trademark humor.  I recommend her historical novels to my friends as hysterical.  This one doesnt quite qualify as that.  That being said this is a rather sweet tale of a young woman left in dire circumstances meeting her slightly tarnished Scotts savior in a kilt.  If you enjoy the occasional historical novel, as I do, then you may want to give this a quick read.",a rather sweet tale of a young woman left in dire circumstances meeting her slightly tarnished Scotts savior in a kilt
1980,"What an amazing book! I found myself caught up in another place and time. Tracie has such an ability to cause the reader to feel the emotions of her characters, making they begin to feel like people you actually know and love. I really appreciate the christian values interwoven through the story...teaching moments...reminders of Christ and His desire for us to live a life that honors Him.","What a wonderful, inspirational story, dealing with a difficult issue, handled beautifully!"
1981,"I used to be a huge fan.  There are no words for how awful her story lines and writing have become.  Page after page of uninteresting self important drivel.  There used to be action and excitement in her novels.  That has all been replaced by the main character's self indulgent obsessing over who she is going to have sex with that night and why she just HAS to.  Nauseating.  I'll never read another of her novels or recommend them.  The first ones where good, but what's the point when the story devolves into this??",I'll never read another of her novels or recommend them. The first ones where good
1982,"Perhaps slightly imaginative? The author does attempt not to reveal an agenda for or against the perception of a Church with a true and genuine spiritual radar. He does portray Cardinals who appear to genuinely believe in their spiritual calling and have sincere devotion, while behaving as mere men in their competitiveness and otherwise human pursuits","Quite compelling, great and notable quotes but also at times slightly far-fetched"
1983,"Anyone who loves nature, and our national parks needs to read this. I never knew that park rangers did as much as they do to take care of the wild animals in their care, as well as keeping those same animals from damaging foolish people who don't understand them. The writing is good, kept my attention which can be a challenge and was mostly a cheerful, sometimes funny, always educational read.","Everyone needs to know what to do when they meet a bear in the wild, read this book and you will learn."
1984,"I really enjoyed this book and this author.  It was written in the first person and felt like a real person.  It dealt with the loss of a loved one  who suffered a strange death and Ty's search for answers.  Sister Mary was a different character to bring into the writing as well as Father Bob.  The sad end of a good friendship is dealt with.  This book I found believable, like everyday life.  I have read book 2 and am now reading book 3.

1986,"With Family is Murder, Carolyn Arnold has created the fifth instalment of the McKinley Mysteries series. I did only read the fourth instalment before  I am going to read instalments 1-3, soon. It is not necessary to have read the previous instalments before; you get to know Sara and Sean quickly. You certainly want to read them, though. Family is Murder offers food for thought with a thrill, being an entertaining and fast read, making you want to read more.

This is a book to read again.",Another very entertaining instalment of a great mystery series!

As a nutritionist, I am always researching ways to help my clients using foods and supplements, and Pam Killeen has really done her research on the cause and treatment for a variety of mental health issues and addictions to Rx drugs as well as foods and beverages.

1988,"The books in this series are, for me, a guilty pleasure, I can't put them down, but I haven't found the more recent installments to be very satisfying.  This was free so I don't really want to complain, but the cemetery of lost books is such a magical place, and this detracted from rather than adding to its wonderful mystique.",and this detracted from rather than adding to its wonderful mystique.
1989,"The book was good and I really enjoyed reading it. Even more than the first book... HOWEVER, if you are hoping to finish the series, you may never.  It drives me crazy when authors don't finish trilogies.  It's the only reason I rated this book a 3 rather than 5 stars is because the last book was suppose to finished last year and rather than finish the series, the author abandoned it and moved on... So who knows what happens!? This book is really good, but you'll be disappointed there is no book 3.  I'm happy to revise the review if that changes.",Author seems to have abandoned the thrilogy and moved on... :(

Have experienced the Walmart work world first hand and then reading Sam Waltons view of it I came to this conclusions for those who ask me my views.

Especially the last two chapters!","Walmart night stoker - great read, especially last two chapters"
1991,"Not the usual Brisbin nail biter. I've read almost all her books and  loved them. This  one went too far; it was the most disturbing, gory, your worst nightmare book I've ever read. Sometimes too much information goes way beyond too much. I had a hard time making myself finish this book. I sure don't want to read the next book in this series. It will take a long time to get the evil, brutal, torturingBe tormenting, bloody, satanic behavior images of this one out of my mind. That has never happened before, and I have read thousands of books!!",Beyond the usual book boundaries of human torture and debasement.
1992,"I never really read very much erotica until I ready the Fifty Shades trilogy and then I was on the hunt to find quality books in the genre. Naked & The Blackstone Affair series definitely qualifies. The erotic scenes are fantastic but the rest of the storyline is amazing as well. We've all read erotic books that have ""block your socks off"" sex scenes but the rest of the story lacks imagination. This is not the case with Raine Miller's writing. I thoroughly enjoyed the second book as well and can't wait for the release of the third installment.","The first series I would recommend as ""Fifty Shade-esque"" is The Blackstone Affair"
1993,"This book is a great read for those who are tuned in to the frequency of this type of information. For those who aren't necessarily conscious yet, it may seem as strange and far fetched information. This is a book that you will have to go back and read a couple of times later on to let the information really soak in. Great read.",Great read for those who are receptive to this type of information
1994,"A short, but thought-inducing book about the Civil War.  These little themed essays are still relevant, even fifty years after its original publication.  Catton's remarks on the technology and tactics that made it the first modern war, or how this war was hard, are especially thought provoking.  A quick read for anyone interested in the Civil War or American history in general.","Still relevant, even fifty years after its original publication"
1995,"Don't skip this one, the book has great detail and goes straight to the point, I found myself glued to each word that Brenda Novak  has written.

1996,I forgot how great this book by one of the greatest chess champions of all time Capablanca was. I haven't read it since I was a kid and now as a Candidate Master 2164 rating I was amazed at how much deep knowledge Capa imparted to us in his notes. His games are a great way to learn about how to place your pieces for maximum coordination in preparation for Capa's famous petite combinations! It is also very instructive to see how his knowledge of endgames guided his late middlegame play to achieve a won endgame.,Capablanca's teaches us deep chess knowledge from his great games when in his prime!
1997,"I do a lot of van camping in New Mexico and needed a good road atlas, something that showed the unpaved roads as well as the interstates. This atlas does that. It also shows the National Forest and BLM lands both of which are usually open for dispersed camping. There is a lot of detail on the maps in this atlas and it can be confusing at times, but I'd rather have the detail and be able to ignore it, than not have the detail and need it.
This atlas fills my needs perfectly.","If you're touring New Mexico, or just want a good road atlas, this is the one for you."
1998,"Konrath and Strand HAVE to do another book combining these characters again!  You have to read this book, it is AWESOME. Great story, and the best parts the dry humor talents of Jeff Strand and JA Konrath (two of my favorites).  Also, if you haven't read their other books, do so as fast as you can, they are all GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you love gore, sick humor and fantastic characters, these are the authors for you. Get the Jack Daniels series of books by Konrath and the Andrew Mayhem series from Strand, THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Waiting for Strand and Konrath to do a follow up to this one!
1999,"An extremely slow-burner by any standard but done so marvellously well. As with many GG novels, the central character [Henry in this instance] inadvertently embarks on a journey of self discovery instigated by the return of his long forgotten aunt Augusta.

I just couldn't put it down!
How many mistakes can be made, when, being so arrogant, prejudiced, and almighty!
And religion, please, it's terrible how those girls we're treated by nuns that were supposed to love, not despise them.

The story takes place on the coast of Mexico where the main character  has sailed to a village on her parents boat. We both loved learning about the culture, traditions and even a bit of Spanish, as well as what life is like on a boat.

I never want to know what it feels like to be in her position but Chelle Bliss made me feel like I was there.  It was heartbreaking.  Bruno....sigh.  Everyone deserves a big strong shoulder like his when in Callie's position, even if he has to break down a few doors to get in.  Great book!",I can only hope that everyone in Callie's position has a cheerleader as great as Bruno.
2005,"A beautifully written and thought provoking story about the tragedy of Val d'Hiver in France at the beginning of WW II. The format that this author used allows  the reader to become totally immersed in the story and feel the pain that Sarah experiences  and then she drops you into the present day and you become obsessed searching for answers.  By far one of my all time favorite books. Highly recommend losing oneself in this wonderful, poignant story.",Lifetime Repercussions From A Dark Day In The History Of France
2006,"I had already read Tana French's Broken Harbour and enjoyed her writing, story telling abilities and her grasp of post-Tiger Ireland. Faithful Place, for me, edges slightly ahead; an exceptionally well-written page turner that captures the Dublin atmosphere and voice outstandingly well. The damp and decay of Liberties Dublin is palpable and the turn of phrase authentic, making the characters jump off the page. Leaves other Irish crime fiction in the shade. Looking forward to more from this author. (Currently reading In The Woods and it does not disappoint, either.)",Well written page turner that captures the Dublin atmosphere and voice outstandingly well
2007,"I have been waiting for the next installment in the Book of Phoenix series since the moment I finished The Space Between. Leni and Jeric made their way into my heart and haven't left. Kristie Cook has that magical ability of being able to draw in her readers and make them believe her worlds are real. She flawlessly mixes the paranormal with heartbreaking real life situations, and does it with class. Read this series. You'll walk away realizing that this isn't your everyday PNR.","Deep, Emotional, and Heartbreaking, with all of the Fun of Paranormal!!"
2008,"Been a fan of Foster's for years.  This is a very different but highly entertaining dip into a new realm of writing and reality.  As always, Foster keeps the reader interested, anticipatory, and often on the edge of their seats.  My only negative is that the book ends practically in mid sentence, like the end of a chapter.  Apparently he plans a host of these in a series.  Series I don't mind.  Chopping off in mid-thought so the reader has to scramble to find the next in the series (at 2+ x the cost) is cheesy.",Another good work by Foster.  Don't like the hook at the end.
2009,"This tween book is an excellent read for our young people who are searching for their own ""identity."" There are some things in life that are most important, such as a person's relationship with God through our Savior Jesus Christ.

2014,Interesting book written in a rather strange manner.  Characters are developed chapter by chapter and as such information is revealed very slowly.  I liked the premise and the main character.  Of course I like artists and find few books  about them.  I would recommend this book as a mystery with a lot of character development if not a lot of action.  Also I now know more about Jack LaLanne than I ever expected to.  Who knew he wore wool?,Different style of mystery with some puzzles and lots of talk.

The type of people you can see yourself becoming good friends with.  The passion and sex is swoon worthy .  Once I started it I couldn't put it down.

2017,"Once again Wheeler weaves bits of wisdom with white knuckle adventure. The characters are complex and unpredictable as they forge loyalties, encounter numerous perils and overcome grave obstacles in what becomes a rousing tussle between the ever present forces of good and evil. He handles the contrasts of hope and despair, self-sacrifice and blind ambition, courage and fear, truth and deceit , genuine love and jealousy driven hatred with the finesse of a much more seasoned author. ""The Whispers of Mirrowen"" fit in my ""Don't interrupt me, I'm reading now"" library of books!","A well-crafted, memorable, page turning conclusion to an engaging work of fantasy fiction."

2020,Most gardeners will really enjoy this book and it will have a major influence on traditional gardening.  The only reason that it was given a four star was that it didn't transfer well to the Kindle version.  Most all the charts ended up being too small to read the appendix was difficult to get to because of some type of pop-up that kept getting in the way.  Otherwise would have given this book a five star in the printed addition.,A real eye opener in allowing nature to play a major roll in gardening

2028,I have not yet finished this book. But it is a good one for the practical application of downsizing the clutter in our lives.

2030,"Gary Wills is an excellent writer and a meticulous researcher.  He never fails to educate, as in ""Papal Sin"" and ""What Jesus Meant.""  The revelations in this book debunk a lot of clerical baloney piled on Catholics since the very early centuries of Christianity.  Every point is backed by painstaking historical and/or Biblical analysis.  The only reason that I did not rate it 5 stars, is some of that analysis is very dense for the layman.",Just as I always thought:  they made a lot of this Catholic stuff up!

2036,"This book (along with Crockford's JS Good Parts) has good learning material to digest once you have begun reading and writing JavaScript after a few months.  The book's best chapters are related to general JS best practices and it touches on important concepts such as namespacing, modules, GoF design patterns, and API development that are of immediate practical use.  However, the book does not go into much depth of solving browser problems and application scenarios, so I cannot give it higher marks.",Good Book for Post-Beginner and Pre-Intermediate JS Developers
2037,"This was an excellent series with plenty of action, intrigue and plot twists. Be advised that the author doesn't pull any punches.

2039,I struggled just to make it halfway through the first chapter and then I gave up. I wasn't drawn in. The most exciting scene from the beginning was short and without detail.

Some other commentaries are so intellectual, I feel like they are only for PHD students, but not this one. This has a wealth of information with scripture throughout the Bible to back it up. What I love most is it continues to draw me closer to the Lord on a daily basis. Before ordering it you can read the whole section on Genesis to see if it is what you are looking for. I fully intend to buy the rest of the series!",Great purchase for drawing me closer to Jesus! You won't regret it! It's worth every penny!

I used it to teach my kids to tell me about their feelings.  It goes way beyond just happy & sad.

It includes a biography of the original Adolf Coors coming to America as an immigrant (with no green card) to the present day.  Beer making was his passion and his obsession, everything else, including his family, was sacrificed.

Even though he comes from a previous design generation, much of his astute commentary is still valid in midst  of the current revolution of cognition-based design.

2052,I think this a very interesting book if you want to know about how the different fashions through the Ancient to the Modern Centuries and how the people wore them and what they looked like.  I make cloth dolls and if your making anything with Cloth dolls or minidolls you need to make everything authentic.

2053,The story is a detailed account of a marine's experience in vietnam with the glory stripped away. It is neither entertaining nor edifying (in the sense that Hamlet or Othello are edifying although tragic). The writing style is clear but the text contains large numbers of obscure abbreviations. I didn't discover until the very end that there was a glossary explaining the abbreviations. Not for the squeamish.,Brutally honest straightforward description of authors experience in vietnam

2057,Complex and intellectually and emotionally engrossing.  So many characters that you fall in love with.  An evil that is truly evil and good which is truly good.  Make sure you read this on a kindle OR have a dictionary near by because Donaldson creates his world through the use of many seldom used or even recognizable words.

We get to explore a different type of protagonist. This girl was a pole dancer in a shady club. She knew girls who got paid for other types of services. But none of them are ever shown as ""dumb skanks"" or ""whores"". They're people. Each with their own lives and motives for being there.

I love that I can get through these books in a few hours and have a much better understanding and or recollection of the event.

The blending of European medieval history and fantasy worked perfectly.  I won't spoil anything for anyone, but I totally did not anticipate what happened to many of the principal characters, which made the story all the more enjoyable and unpredictable.

Just as people are no longer writing as they used to (from what I'm told), they seem to want to hurry through their books. A shame. If the writing is good, it should be the enjoyment.
I find this writing very good.
Hope to write more later.",I'm just 19 pages in and it's a pleasure to read. Depth of characters.
2079,"I really enjoyed reading this book.  I rarely read autobiographical books.  I wish my son would read it, with an open mind.  He claims to be an atheist and needs a Saviour, just like we all do.  Thanks Kirk.  More importantly,  thank you Lord for bringing Kirk to yourself and to your great commission.  Please continue to let the light of your wondrous Grace shine.  Amen",Very interesting and inspiring...especially the appendix and ending words.
2080,"I've read all the books in the M, SW series.  This one, ""Murder, She Wrote: Murder on the QE2"" is the best one.  Jessica's excitement about her new ocean-crossing trip, her nostalgia about traveling the ocean with her late husband, Frank, and the unexpected twists in the story, gave the book more depth and mystery.  I loved it!  Val","Read, ""Murder, She Wrote: Murder on the QE2"".  It's the Best, So Far!"
2081,"This is a charming short story using a main character from the author's Witches of Galdorheim series. What I most enjoyed about this tale was that the main character is a boy who is ""different"" (half-vampire, half witch) and in search of his own unique identity. That's a lot for a short story to carry off, and Spellslinger does it very well indeed.

I've read other books in this series and reading this short story made me want to return to The Witches of Galdorheim to revisit this world.","Loved the main character and his problems in this story, good read"
2082,"Giving you a five because I totally went to your world and loved my time there. Also, Susan, if you read your review,. I wore garanimals clothing in fifth grade.

I had a good time in your world.",... five because I totally went to your world and loved my time there
2083,"As some other reviewers have noted, this really isn't a kids book.  Even with a picture of Otto the teddy bear on the cover of the book it really is for kids 11, 12, and older.  It is a sweet book though, in spite of being small.  With less than 20 pages it manages to cover much of what World War II was about.  An educational book which is also very touching.  I especially like the last page where Otto is at the typewriter telling his story.",Otto:  The Autobiography of a Teddy Bear:  Purchased at Amazon.com
2084,"I rather wish that I had read all the reviews, instead of only the positives. The Accidental Life of Greg Millar had an interesting premise and title. The author writes well and her characterizations, particularly of Lucy, were sound. But, once I passed the halfway point and learned the nature of Greg's personal issues, I simply no longer cared. The second half dragged and I found myself initially skimming to get the end...and then dropping the book altogether.",Invested time reading more than half the book...but could not complete
2085,"When I started reading it, it was fine. I was excited, even. Then his poor, arrogant, judgemental attitude came shining through. It's sadly not worth returning, so I'm waiting to see what I'm moved to do with it.

This turned out disappointing as it was a gift, along with his other book... that I also cannot stand.",Ugh. Avoid if you want info instead of bigotry and personal bias.
2086,"This was a fantastic read! The story was great and very interesting. It takes you from one world into another. Has panther shifters and so much more!

If you love Paranormal Romance, this book is for you!"
2087,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about changing their life choices to becoming healthier. Why wouldn't anyone want to be healthier by following nature's ways instead of filling our bodies with toxins! I have been taking supplements for years and I am still learning better foods to eat and so many foods to avoid. Thank goodness for people like Mr. Ellison, who are concerned about telling us the truth!","The Best book I've read on commonsense supplementation, eating and living the way we were intended to do!"

2089,"Lanier is a great thinker and the thoughts presented here have the potential to shape the digital world. Establishing the right institutions, rules of the road, property rights and micro-payment mechanism as recommended in the book can re-shape the digital world. The continued power curve where winners take all is not sustainable - and we need a mechanism (wealth tax, income tax and/or micro-payment mechanism) will mend the ways to establish a circulatory system.",Great thoughts on what is wrong and how to fix it with the current digital economy.
2090,"I can't lie, when this popped up on my recommendations I was excited, especially after reading the reviews. It DID draw me in right away, but it didn't keep me there. The characters don't have any substance. I didn't feel a connection with any of them. I read it through thinking it would get better...and it did at the end. Which is why I purchased the second book. Big mistake. Same problems with huge chunks of time missing. This will be the first series EVER that I started and just don't care what happens next.",This book hooked me right away. Too bad it didn't keep me there.
2091,"When receiving an ARC copy of Substitute Bride by Noelle Adams, I agreed to write an honest review of her latest project. As the second book about the Beaufort sisters, readers were welcomed into the world of familiar characters and new faces. Describing the romance of Rose and James, this book shows how love can come in many forms - through children, family, and friends. Themes of hope and companionship are felt throughout the book, truly coming alive in the last scene of Chapter 12 (becoming one of my favorite literary passages).",this book shows how love can come in many forms - through children
2092,"Author uses masterful command of the English language to create unique spin on ghost tale.  Book is probably aimed at Young Adult audience, however the adult audience will enjoy too.

Well done book...as is all of Jonathan Stroud's books!","Great story, well told...entertaining, fast, funny...as ever!"
2093,"A lovely history of Kundalini Sadhana that also happens to explain the reason I have started to wake regularly at four a.m.  Not that one has to get up that early to practice, but at least on those days that I do, I can move into a wonderful spiritual and meditative practice before the rest of my household joins me.",Really solid and instructional for those learning about morning sadhana
2094,"A great book on technology and it's potential consequences and gifts. Skillfully written. My husband (an IT professional) and I have both read all of his books now and love them.

They have inspired hours of discussion.",A great book on technology and it's potential consequences and gifts
2095,"This fourth installment in the series actually focuses on a different couple and story that is unveiled in the first three books. While this novel isn't quite as strong as the first three, it still was a very enjoyable extended Regency era piece with characters that are compelling enough to keep me interested. In some ways, this pair (Iain and James) are a bit more stereotypical than the more nuanced characters in the first three books, but I actually felt more empathy with James and more doe-eyed appreciation for Iain than I did for the overly honorable David or the rakish Lord Murdo.",Enjoyable male/male Regency romance (with a solid historical setting)
2096,Wow! Eden Summers did a fantastic job as always delivering TJ and Cassie's story to us! The first 10 chapters your in complete suspense mode. My mind was racing on scenarios of why their marriage had to end. When I finally got my answer I was in tears and cursing TJ out loud! The reasoning was so selfish of him and unreasonable. I was aggravated with TJ being way too over protective of Cassie! The emotions you will feel while reading this story will have your heart racing and blood pounding through your ears! Totally awesome writing!,"Awesome story! TJ and Cassie's story was suspensful, heart breaking and romantic!"
2097,"I received a free copy of this book in return for an honest review - and I honestly enjoyed the heck out of it. Not only was it based on the true story of Ted Bundy, but it introduced a great series of unique characters, fully developed, but also kept me guessing whodunit until the very end. Did just about everything I read mysteries for. This is my second John Jordan novel to read and I'm sure it won't be the last. Very satisfying.",... return for an honest review - and I honestly enjoyed the heck out of it

2099,I think this the most important book I've ever read. It confirms so much of what I have suspected over the past 10 years. I had no idea that it was this deep or pervasive.

2100,"Awesome story. The watercolors are beautiful.

I bought a copy for my wife for Christmas. We have read this to our kids during the Christmas season since they were little.

Check your local library for Edna Miller's books. Although we haven't read them all, Mousekin's Golden House and Mousekin's Thanksgiving are wonderful. I just purchased Mousekin's Frosty Friend for my wife as well. Another highly enjoyable book. Mousekin's Easter Basket was a little disappointing.",Wonderful story. Delightful artwork. A treat for the whole family.
2101,"I've long felt that most children's books must operate on two levels: they have to be intriguing and accessible to the children who are the intended audience, but they must also be interesting to the adult who reads the story.  In this book a little boy uses his imagination to storm castles, explore jungles, shadow box, sail ships, and swim in the sea all on his way to the bath (or in the bath).  It sounds wonderful, but in fact it's a little flat.  The illustrations and the text are colorful, but bland.  I want to like the book, but don't.","OK for its intended target age, dull for the adults who read along"
2102,"I found this book at my public library, and found it to be of great assistance.  I bought it as a reference, and would highly recommend it to anyone who suffers from erectile dysfunction.  Every solution is discussed and explored, the pros and cons, and it will help you ask the right kind of questions of your doctor.  I also feel that it would be a great book for doctors, specifically urologists to have on hand to educate their patients.

I prefer the cut of the bikini briefs of the 1970's to 1990's era. The new look, after 2002 makes the girls legs look short as compared to the vintage look which gave the girls legs a longer appearance. There are a select few old school bikinis in this book.",I bought this as a standard to compare my photography and to use as a POSE Guide.
2104,"I was impressed by the thoroughness of the biography and also by the author's effort to be balanced in his approach to Erich Fromm. Although the author appropriately recognizes the greatness of Fromm and his substantial contributions, he does not ignore the shortcomings in his personal life. I found this book was very helpful in understanding the context under which Fromm developed his ideas.",Highly recommended for those interested in the work of Erich Fromm
2105,"This book didn't sound like something I would normally read, but it has great reviews, so why not?  I was pleasantly surprised with a wonderful trip through the history of the fictional Convent of the Swallows, from the 1500's onward, although the convent is much older than that.  From the inquisition, to the convent's expansion into the Americas, learning to live alongside the Incas, and more.

A great holiday gift for young and old alike.","A thoughtful reminder, for young and old, of what a Presidency should be"
2111,"This book certainly provides the reader with plenty of action.  The main character is a kick ass female -- a character usually portrayed by a male.  However, the story might have been better if the personal relationships had more depth.  Just when you thought she would get really interested in and close to someone, something would happen to that person.  I'm not asking for a lot of sex or love and kisses.  But some depth of personal relationships would have made the reader more invested in the character.  But still a good action read.","Good action, but less character relationship depth than desired"
2112,"This story pulled me in for the duration. For one, it takes place in the Navajo reservation of New Mexico and Japan. Both places where well described in details I could follow in real time. For another, I always felt there could be a connection with the Navajo way of life and that of the ancient Japanese connection to nature and seasonal lifestyle. For a coming to age story of a young adult, this story pulled me along as it did Jet, who had to follow her lead to find out about her past, as well as her future. And in the end, decide on her own path to follow.",A story showing a strong connection of the Navajo way of life with the Ancient Japanese lifestyle
2113,"This was a tough read. The cultural differences were interesting and a Japanese Don Juan is just the start of the story.  I think that one needs to appreciate Japanese culture to get this book.

I have never lived in Paris as a student but spent about 20 years there and know the Cite Universitaire quite well as my hospital was located right in front of it.

The friendship that develops among English speaking young people and the way friendship develops with the local French is very cleverly described. I suppose that things are exactly as the author describes.

The initial stance that the author takes (why should not girls behave like guys?) is very interesting. After all, why not?",A very interesting description of a certain type of Parisian life
2115,A good story with interesting people populating the mystery. Good looking Miguel and feisty Paige add zip and spice to the whole. Jake and the rattlesnakes keep a reader on their toes.

Only if you have short snippets of time and short attention spans and know _Moby Dick_ and have read everything else out there.

The heroine, Jordie, is a joy, compassionate and caring. When the audio book became available, we devoured it while on a two-day driving trip.

large number of human apes that mimic the book's proposition, towards primarily their children, and proudly

This was a book that kept me guessing with every single page. I had no idea what to expect next and that's exactly what made me LOVE it even more.

The author a French volunteer in the German army writes about his awful experience fighting in the Ukraine and then the Baltic. Always being pushed back, often starving and ragged, Sajer recounts the horrible and depraved conditions that German soldiers fought under during the last two years of WWII.

Most of the published verses refer to places or things that have no meaning to Westerners (or probably even modern Easterners), but are specific to some unrelatable tale of the times, full of incomprehensible places and people.

2145,"In the audio version, the author admits his agenda after the end of the book. He want to take all proceeds from sales and make a movie to spread his message to a larger audience. Regretfully he has some of my money to do just that.

His message is that there is no need to abide by any rules or principals of God or Christ. The he throws in for good measure that the Bible did not come from God. And Jesus has no interest in humans being Christians.

Of course his disaster of a movie, The Green Berets, didn't help his image.  What I do like about John Wayne and I still do is that he presented an image of a solid and strong man.  The type that one would like to incorporate in one's own character.  The author gives an excellent account of Wayne's own character development, flaws included.  Overall, he was both important to the industry and a generally good person.","Funny how so few ""major"" contemporary actors of Wayne's time are much less relevant to current movie fans."

I thought it might be ok to start, but Caroline's character and the author's overly descriptive narrative quickly started to bore me.  I am not sure if there was any relevance to continually describing the shape of the bump on Caroline's head or whether or not her mother was English or not.

The book is well written and fast-paced with a lot of action.  The style is interesting.  It reminds me of World War Z in that the author always carefully explains why things are the way they are.  THe giant tanks are surprising in that they are more like real people than the harsh logical machines of most military science fiction but then why not.

There are long winded passages of material about the main character's past that have at best a peripheral relationship to the main focus ... the solving of a family's murder.

Gabby has a heart of gold. She is everybodys buddy and nobodys everything. She is coming up on her thirtieth birthday and wants someone bad enough to let the town Battleaxes (aka matchmakers and busybodies) set her up on a blind date. When that date turns out to be her best friend Flynn things start to get strange. This best friends to lovers tale will make your heart sing and renew your faith in love.,This best friends to lovers tale will make your heart sing and renew your faith in love.
2272,The book covers a topic from the securitynow Steve Gibson perspective and does it well I think. Its a difficult topic in that you cannot really be 100% private you can instead can take most reasonable precautions. One thing you should ready this on a kindlefire or Ipad instead of a strict kindle reader as there are links you need to follow.,Covers as well as possible but read it on a device you can browse web on
2273,"The coverage this book has is pretty decent, but overall I do not recommend it. The book doesn't cover a number of important areas and the test questions at the end are less than spectacular. In fact, all of the Que test questions I've seen are pretty bad. I'd also like to point out that any test prep book that seriously advocates putting a moat around a installation to increase physical security is questionable at best.","Decent content, poorly written, and the test questions are crap"
2274,Most books writing about the Apaches or for that matter any tribe or nation generally does not delve into the unique tactics of their conflicts. By the very nature and name of this book it went into much more detail on the difficulty of fighting the Apache Indians in their own backyard. Both sides suffered enormously and US forces would in fact never been able to defeat the Apaches without the assistance of the Apache scouts.,Gave me fresh insight about how hard it must have been to fight the Apaches
2275,"Just an awesome informative and well-written book by Chris Edwards.  Honest and witty memoir detailing with struggles of transitioning from female to male.  Being a post-op transgender gay male myself, this was an extremely well-thought out authentic journey to be our true selves.  Would recommend this read to allies of the transgender community as well as to the transgender community at large to give a voice to our struggles as well as our strengths in transitioning.","LOVED, LOVED, LOVED THE TITLE ""BALLS, IT TAKES SOME TO GET SOME,"" PROFOUNDLY AUTHENTIC TRANSITION JOURNEY"

She meets up with several companions; among them  'Aed and Iseult.  Each have their unique history and secrets.  They go on an adventure and Finn hopes to learn about herself and why her change has occurred.  Very enjoyable read, some exciting moments and hints of possible/ potential romance.  Happy Reading!!!

2277,"I loved the quirky senior men and women in a retirement community that gives new meaning to the word active. Numerous parallel storylines, covering teenagers, young adults, middle-age adults, and seniors, converge in the shocking climax. This dramedy has plenty of belly laughs, sex, drama, romance, and heartache cleverly woven into real-life situations. The sex scene with the portly dowager was cringe-worthy but hilarioustrue comedic genius. Alias: Mitzi & Mack provides hours of fun entertainment.",Brilliantly crafted characters reminiscent of Janet Evanovich and Dave Barry
2278,"We are a popcorn family. We have pounds and pounds of popcorn in our
freezer as I write this.
I bookmarked several of the recipes today, so that we can try those first.

I like how they've included nutritional info on each recipe, but the one
thing they didn't include (that I wished they had) was a little one or two
sentence summary about the recipe, and what to expect taste-wise.

That, to me was the only negative.
Otherwise...a bunch of good recipes, both sweet and savory, for the popcorn
lover in your household.",WE are a popcorn family...so this is a treat even before we get started!
2279,"Interesting ""Elizabethan""-type fantasy, it ignores most of the conventional fantasy elements - no quasi-medeival setting, no 'humble hero with a big destiny', no wise wizards guiding the way, no Dark Lord, etc etc.
Instead it's full of court intrigue and power struggles, magic and gunpowder, and interesting characters.

I long the Scouting program and do my best to read all I can about it.  Four Percent not only tells you of the history of the BSA but abut the lives of the Scouts that made that history.  Excellent book and one every Scout should read.  I will be giving it to my whole troop.",what I got was one of the best histories of Scouting that I have ever read
2281,This was the second book in the series and I loved it as much as the first. Levi was my favorite character.

2284,This is one of my all-time favorite books. I have read my original copy from high school many times and the pages are falling out. I saw the leather-like cover on this one and didn't buy it at the time. It was gone when I went back for it and have been looking for it ever since. So happy to have found it on Amazon!,"Timeless classic story, much prefer over the teen angst in newer vampire series."
2285,"I loved this book, and it tops of the Revelation Space series beautifully (the stories are from throughout that continuity though, some long before the beginning of the action, some long after). After finishing it one could have a really interesting conversation about the themes he constructed in his stories. Perhaps with me.","This just made me want to be a Conjoiner really, really badly"
2286,"An encouraging blend of theology and motherhood. In considering the everyday, often mundane tasks of being a mom, the author reveals all the ways we are already practicing the spiritual disciplines of our faith; things like perseverance, sacrifice and nurture. Full of practical tips for stepping into these spiritual spaces throughout the day as well. What a treasure.",A beautifully written how-to on spiritual disciplines for mothers
2287,Very good book.  It mostly tells you that a lot of American generosity is going to graft and the people who need it are not getting a good share of the money.  Phony schools where the teachers either don't show up or not even close to being competent.  The author did a very good job on telling like it is.  People barely serviving.,Down to earth book about real poor people in India.  Still a cruel place for untouchables.
2288,"Outstanding reference.  Although fearing that this would be an FTM dissertation, Matt provides a very neutral synopsis of what is reality for the transgendered -- clouding the issues with FTM experiences only because Matt was FTM and has only that experience to draw upon.

2290,I love this book because it has the death certificate of the boy he prayed for that was raise from the dead. It also tells how he and his wife met and how their courtship came about. It shows pictures of people he prayed for and the crusades that he preached at and prayed for healing. I highly recommend it.,Great Evidence to Back Up what Mahesh Has Stated in His Book!!!
2291,"My eight year old daughter and I really enjoyed this book (and the sequel!)  Lots to love here with adventure, and friendship, danger and suspense.  I would generally recommend this book for 8-12 year olds, especially those that may have enjoyed The Magic Treehouse series as younger readers.  I would also liken this series to the Narnia books.  Have fun traveling to another world to find out about ""The Thirteenth Unicorn""!","The 13th Unicorn - excellent book for kids, also fun for adults that like to read young adult type fiction."
2292,"Collects Wolverine issues #66-72  and Wolverine Giant-Size Old Man Logan

This is one of my favorite graphic novels that I've read in recent years.  Set in one possible future, Wolverine is an old man.  All the heroes are gone, but the mystery is about what happened to them.  This book has a western vibe, with Old Man Logan (now a pacifist) refusing to fight against the corrupt power that now runs (what used to be) the United States.  There were a lot of layers to this comic.  It was very brutal in some parts, and even though that's not normally my thing, I think this book was worth the read.",This is one of my favorite graphic novels that I've read in recent years.
2293,"As much as I love female-empowering roles I did not like these stories.  The concept is unique:  different authors create a different character who will ultimately meet each other and interact.  I was not a fan of the overall schema.

2298,What are amphibians? This is a great book for young children who are interested in any sort of animal. As a kid I loved amphibians. I thought they were so interesting because of their duality of living on land and in water.

Wonderful story arch that grows and expands right where it needs to. Jonathan is well thought out and likable. The Never Hero takes the comic book genre to a new, exciting level.

The story line speaks for itself, as to power, but the Pinkneys' handling of it somehow increases the depth of it.  The artwork is breathtaking.

2326,"Excellent little volume on the historical and practical importance of family worship. This is certainly a short book, but I definitely think it's worth the price. It's packed with biblical wisdom on really just three areas: reading the Bible as a family, praying the Bible as a family, and singing the Bible as a family.

Stegner is a great writer.  Such precise prose.  The characters are finely developed, complex people - a million miles away from simplistic good guys or bad guys.  In the end it is kind of a sad book, truthfully, but at the same time it ends on a note of lovely hope.  I really, really loved this book.","Beautiful novel with deeply complex characters, & a great appreciation of nature."

Sometimes I find that I want to read more meaningful books and not as many quick reads, but I can't get myself to because then I just won't want to read them and won't be able to get through them quickly. This book was different. I couldn't put it down and finished it in a weekend. It tells the story of an incredible child, and it really is the tragic life of Robert Peace.

What I take away is that the cold theology we are taught is often inadequate training when we come face to face with homosexuality in our own family.  Her struggles between her theology and her love for her husband are very real human reactions -- trying to reconcile what she knows is true about him and what her theology says she must do.  If you can read this book without stopping and weeping, you need a softened heart.",It will change some minds; some it won't; but all are better for reading it.

2338,"While this book may not end how the far away sailor would like it to, there are many lessons to be learned along the way.  Glenn's honest, unabashed, and forthright story telling makes this book a good read. The information he imparts to the reader, from the experiences he had, are invaluable to the novice blue water sailor.  Great job Mr. Damato, may our paths cross over tropical waters and a bottle of Becks beer.",Informative read and an adventurous triumph of the human spirit
2339,"Author McDonald does a decent job in giving the play by play of the summer that Maine native and Penobscot Indian Louis Sockalexis spent with the Cleveland franchise in the National League back near the turn of the 20th century.  Though too much time is spent describing the game details and not enough on the Native American experience and Sockalexis place in it, I can recommend this book to baseball fans and Mainers interested in finding out how (possibly) the Cleveland franchise in today's American League came to be known by its present day nickname.",Workmanlike effort to tell the sad tale of the original Cleveland Indian
2340,Think about it  this is the way you would really eat anyway if you weren't stressing about gaining weight. The more you worry about gaining weight the more you gain you know it's true! Anyway you eat very little on two nonconsecutive days and eat normally for the other 5. Easy! My 89-year-old mother has managed to lose 12 pounds in six months. She is not very active by the way and yet this works wonderfully well.,The only diet I've come across in half a century that actually makes sense and works
2341,One of the best books on the history of cryptography and codes. From the code of Mary Queen of Scots to the Navajo Code Talkers to modern computer programmers it is a must read. It is a taxing read. Sometimes you have to reread certain parts because the book throws so much information at you at once. But I enjoy the challenge of reading such books. Highly recommended!!!!,One of the best books on the history of cryptography and codes
2342,"I read so many fantasy books that I am very picky like you better be good book otherwise you goin' down.

This book was Meh. I did enjoy it, but would I read the other books?Nope.

When I saw Dr Weil's latest book on medications was available for request on NetGalley, I jumped at the opportunity to educate both of us about the drugs that are frequently prescribed and their side effects.

2346,"This story has such beautiful emotionthese guys love for each other shines off the pages even as they dance on each others every nerve. As far as second-chance romances go, this one kicks butt and takes names.

It's also on the rougher, angstier aside. Nate has serious domination tendencies, Kyle is a power bottom, and they both revel in pushing limits, both physically and emotionally. The Christmas setting in this story adds a cheerful layer of hope and celebration to the snapping tension between the two men, making for a gripping, emotional story.","Angsty and edgy, this out-for-you gay romance has heady emotion and a lovely Hollywood holiday setting"
2347,"Like others have mentioned, addition of the blue glitter line is wonderful for young readers- regardless, this story is a wonderful way to introduce line art and constructing theory of lines with young learners in an inquiry approach-- very open-ended, leaving a vast number of options creative facilitators of learning can utilize- supplements well with the dot also.","MUST have this in your collection- introduction to line art, concept of lines for young minds, A+"

The artist does show how she develops her projects in a helpful manner. I bought the book because I wanted to look at the picture since I like the way she draws. I really enjoyed seeing the very big wall project that she was working on after having seen tiny pieces. I liked what she wrote as well, I rarely read all the art books I buy, I just like looking at the pictures.",Inspirational for the beginner and more advanced artist as well.
2349,"I enjoyed the descriptions of some characters involved in art, otherwise I felt the poor heroine had, more than usual, tragedies befall her which would put anyone else into years of therapy.

2350,This is my least favorite of the Justice books. First we have a few chapters about Brody and Heather and then we switch to a few chapters about the upcoming wedding of Alex and Meghan then back and forth. The format was most annoying and I could not get into the romance between Brody and Heather. Actually there was not much romance in this book. Considering the cliffhanger (which I HATE) ending I will probably wait for reviews before buying the next book.,This is my least favorite of the Justice books...Cliffhanger...Too much D/s...Very little romance.

2353,"A nice quick read.  I enjoyed it but I felt like King was rushing to meet a publisher's deadline.  The last portion of the book was a little too neatly wrapped.  Was he trying to make me think of Dr. Frankenstein?  I hoped he would spend more time with the  ""why does God allow bad things to happen to good people"" theme.  The ""terrible sermon"" was quite intriguing but I felt neglected as the book moved forward.  It's still a good read by a really good author.",Think Dr. Frankenstein meets Scout/Boo Radley meets  Dr. Emmett Brown
2354,"The premise was good. The cast of characters was interesting and well thought out. The outline of the story was interesting. The pace of the story was sufficient. ...

It took me forever to guess a bit of what was going on and usually I get a pretty good idea fairly quickly. It still contained fantasy and magic, but this one seemed a bit darker with more intense feelings and a sense of responsibility, etc which made me a little edgy. That said it didn't keep me from enjoying it thoroughly!

I am highly upset at those Amazon reviewers who questioned whether or not he was really an abused child.  This is Dave Pelzer's view of his world as a child.

2406,"This was a long book with a lot of story but well worth it.  Interesting look at mental heath care of the time (although can't say much has changed although we now  understand what happened to the hero - won't spoil it for readers though).

I would put this book in the category that The Wedding Journey (Carla Kelly) is in.  Much more than a simple love story and at times difficult to get through.",Read this if you want more than a simple love story (not that there is anything wrong with that!)
2407,"I was really excited to get some other ideas for triathlon workouts, but this book is a bit chaotic and I find I don't really use it.  They seem to have collected workout ideas from different people, but didn't take time to format them in a similar fashion to one another.  So, it takes a few times to read through a workout to figure out what to do.  I really just want to grab a workout & go and not want to have to spend time sorting through the different styles of instructions.","Meh, don't really use it much because the formatting is chaotic"
2408,"A rare book that has the author doing original thinking, not just churning what we already know.

For that matter, it should be required reading for every judicial system judge in order to be appointed to the bench. Likewise for every student who wants to learn anything.",The universal Kahneman should be required reading for humans.
2409,"Listened to this as an Audible book. The narration was excellent, the story not so much. It's a grim tale of mystery and betrayal, without much sub-stratum of likeability. The main character is victimized, but also a victimizer. The mise-en-scene is interesting: marshy, dour 19th century England in claustrophobic small-town society.","Everyone in it is unlikeable, but the setting -- marshy, dour Victoriana -- is interesting"
2410,"I do not think that this book was nearly as enjoyable as any of her Virgin River or Thunder Point series books. ( I have read all of both series) This book seemed to get bogged down in way too much medical and legal"" technical jargon"" and that is not what I enjoy reading in a novel. I will try to stay optimistic that the future books in her new series, are a bit more lighthearted, and will probably wait until the next one is released in paperback due to cost of hardback edition.",Robyn Carr is capable of much more enjoyable stories than this one !

2415,"I enjoyed reading more about young Evan and his desire to help bring home kidnapped children, whether alive or dead, even though his visions put him in harm's way. I also enjoyed Taylor's character because of his revelation that he could make a difference like Evan instead of hiding out. I can see this is going to be a chapter type series, which I'm sure I'll read. I've enjoyed all of Michael Grumley's books and highly recommend them. My favorite is the BREAKTHROUGH series. All, very well written. Michael, I wouldn't mind paying more if you wrote novels (~400 pages). '","Second book in the EVAN series, and just as good as the first."
2416,"The beauty of the concept of touching of the parallel universes of life and death is ruined by the ugliness of human nature and it's inability to cope with the idea of the immortal soul and God's purpose for man after death. In this highly imaginative tale, some of the dead return to earth to complete unfinished purposes in their families and communities. The way they are treated and dealt with ultimately are a commentary on humanity and it's lack of awareness that

I wish Michael had shown more inclination to changing his lifestyle without so much direct influence from Beatrix.  Too many people falter when their conversion is so directly based on someone else's faith.","Technically a clean read.  Tamara Leigh's storytelling is riveting, as always."

The book provides a welcome look at the men who went off on a hopeless mission and gives us a glimpse of the meaning of their actions from their perspectives.

The men who followed them hoped for something more immediate, acted with great courage and gave rise to a public reaction that eventually made Home Rule an impossibility and the Republic inevitable.",Courage and self sacrifice win through defeat to make the Republic possible.

As soon as I picked up this novel, I knew that I was going to fall head over heels in love. The writing was written absolutely beautifully, in almost a poetic verse.

However, the writing style grabs you from the beginning.  I appreciate the story being written from different viewpoints of several of the main characters.  I think that the people who are reviewing this negatively did not bother to read the entire book.  Don't listen to them.  ;-)  I sure hope to read more books by this author.",Excellent!

Very very disjointed as if the writer felt that they had only 60 seconds of attention span to deal with in each chapter. Picked up the book in a hurry at a club store...bad decision.

OK. I really liked it; great prose, spot-on dialogue, fully realized characters and a trip into places and people in US society I did not know existed -- though they are all around me. For me, quite a page turner. When I was done, I felt I ""knew"" the people and had visited the places. Very well written.

The teenager is vitally interested in what he might learn during the get together, because he would really like to know who his mother was.","Funny, semi-tragic houseparty of friends who have grown apart"

Double words, sentences that don't make sense and missed spellings don't allow the story to flow smoothly. This has been a problem throughout this entire series of Vale books. I hate to have to stop and re-read a sentence to try and figure out what the author is trying to say because printing  mistakes weren't caught.

Clearly Amanda needs her own retro series with Evelyn and old Roz, that sneaky b***h.  This took a large step in that direction and the trip was satisfying.

I'll definitely check out anything else Grossart puts out in the future.",based on how much fun this book and The Gemini Effect were to read

This effort falls flat. The plot is so predictable I could have given the ending less than two percent of the way in. The characters are one dimensional. The sex is actually boring.

2598,"Joan Slonczewski is a brilliant science fiction writer, and her brilliance is well on display in The Highest Frontier. She packs in more visionary science extrapolation in one chapter than most writers do in entire books, and her political imagination is equally vivid and compelling.

Her books are so dense they can be hard to get into at first (I had that trouble even with the magnificent Door Into Ocean), but they are well worth the effort. I read THF once really fast (couldn't wait to see how it ended), and then more slowly to get more of the nuances. Can't wait to read future books.","Amazing scientific visioneering, amazing political analyses, a plot that grows like a nanofabricated dormitory!"
2599,"I really enjoyed this ""what if"" take off of Jane Austen's P&P. I applaud any author who attempts to bring us into the lives of Darcy and Elizabeth as there is much to brave when taking on Austen's characters. In saying this, the author did an excellent job staying true to Austen's characters and does an excellent job of keeping you turning pages to find out what happens next.
An enjoyable read for any Darcy and Elizabeth fan, wanting/needing a new adventure with these two.
I'll be looking for more books from this author!",If you love Darcy and Lizzy...get ready for your next enjoyable read!

Too much girly, girly, not much in historical background and an ever boring hero with a baby on his own, all of which has been done by numerous other authors to the point of boredom. Where is the style of the Courtney's?????",Wilbur Smith has lost it. Ever since he married his books have been more and more like reading Jilly Cooper
2601,"I really enjoyed this book. There are many books written out there about hitting bottom and having to climb out. But to have to do it with no memory of even have had a former life, makes it that much harder. Imagine waking up to discover you have a wife, children, and a very prosperous career. The story is about a family coming to terms with their new ""normal"" and learning what is really important in life. Well written and kept me running back to my kindle to see how it all comes together. Or IF they all come together.","An inspiring book and I appreciated the author's honesty, even when it didn't always put him in the best light."
2602,"Every supporting character is one dimensional while Scarlett Johanssen, looking absolutely beautiful, is given predictable situations and dialogue against the stoic and clueless Laura Linney.  The voice over setting this film up as an anthropological study does not remain throughout some of the most important incidences in the film.  It becomes a non-entity set against flat, nondramatic moments.  A disappointment all the way 'round about what could be a compelling subject.","Sadly, a flat and inconsistent film with little dramatic tension"
2603,"So I read this series in order (books 1 through 4) and this one probably had the best character development in the series, but I didn't like the story line as much as A Cryptic Case and A Tangled Teaser.

2604,"William Carey, a man who drastically changed the culture of an entire nation through his sacrifice and willingness to obey and go.
It was a pretty quick read, it's honestly overwhelming thinking about everything that changed from him being there not just in India, but within his own life.

I highly recommend it.",A Nifty Excursion Complete with Dark Dreams and Unforgettable Characters
2661,"I love the style of the artwork, perfect for the very young lady of this book! I'm not sure of the verse--might be more in tune with young readers to have them in verse style instead of run-on sentences. The meter is also a bit out of sync--mixture of short lines and longer ones.

My main discomfort with Lily's Room is how perfect and rich it appears. More children would feel sympathy with Lily if she had more regular toys and dolls--not EVERYTHING being so pretty and neat.",Some children won't connect with a perfect room with perfect things and perfect little girl.
2662,"Not sure what I was expecting - maybe some insight into why I am the way I am and what to do about it? Needless to say, if you're trying to help someone who is NOT the child of an alcoholic understand some of the tendencies of children of alcoholics, this book is probably helpful. Otherwise, I didn't really learn anything I didn't already know. It might be helpful for some, but didn't do a whole lot for me.",Might be helpful or insightful for some. Wasn't my cup of tea.
2663,"This book emphasizes a lot of great people skills that we would all benefit from practicing. These are not just techniques to climb the latter at work or over power all those around you.

In addition, this book gives practical advice on basically how to conduct your self to come across positively and with believably to be more persuasive.",Great tips on persuasion and improving your people skills too!
2664,"Roach is a great author and her particular brand of humor comes through, again, but just too many chapters on major war injuries, rotting flesh, etc that made many chapters too unbearable to read.  When she wrote about food, uniforms, testing procurement procedures I learned a lot and was entertained too.  But too many other chapters I couldn't stomach.",Roach is a great author and her particular brand of humor comes through
2665,"This book though, only gets into a few reasons for exploring the world, describing only a few benefits that are at the tip of the iceberg.  The rest if mostly a how-to guide that covers some practical aspects of it.  So far, there hasn't been a book that addresses all the deep real life reasons for living overseas.  In short, it talks only about the HOW of expatriation, not the WHY.  And shouldn't the WHY be dealt with first?  That's what all these authors seem to be missing, except for me.  Perhaps the ""WHY"" reasons are taboo?

Thanks for reading this review.

2666,"Disappointment of a series. A talented writer but the flow of the story was off. Small SPOILER: When I figured it was mostly doom and gloom with no small victories along the way to keep you engaged, I started just skimming until the end of the series. If you start reading from the half of book 3 until the end you wouldn't miss whole premise of the previous books. I was too deep in drop it all together.",Skip and read the last half of book 3 and 4.

It seems that almost all the ""prepper"" type books have main characters that have lots of money to spend and i've only read a very few that deal with the normal person.

Yes, I appreciated the parables, the clear interpretation of the Tao in contemporary life. No, I was not trying to change. Was it the words or the space in between the words?

That aside, I just loved the storyline- looking for it on and off for a couple years was worth it to now own the whole series so far! A definite must-read. My hope is that the next book actually comes out, so word to the interested- it's been several years since the last book was released.",Terrific read! But word to the wise- series still in progress

It was hard to put down and I loved every second.,I wasn't sure at first if I would like the direction it was going
2682,"I enjoyed this book, although I did find that the storyline seemed to jump quite abruptly between the heroine's love life and her professional one. It felt a little disjointed in places, but this did not detract from my enjoyment of the story. I would also recommend a little more editing and proofreading, just to polish it up.

However the middle turned into a young adult romance adventure complete with obligatory lesbian sex, which was nice, however the end was way too saccharine sweet for this old sailor.

I did not find the story as bad as some of the reviews indicated. However, it could have benefitted from more character development. There are lots of sex scenes (nothing kinky though) ... and not enough dialogue between the characters. The f-word was used very liberally throughout the book. On the upside, the intro was cute and sweet, and the last few chapters were touching. One more ""plus"", it's a stand-alone story.","Some sweetness, some endearing moments and a whole lot of lust"

There was sufficient negativity happening to the main character so it kept the reader turning pages as fast as one could.  Not all endings were good ones, so the book was realistic and compelling.  A great read and I highly recommend it.",While this old salt would have loved to see more scenes showing actions at sea
2725,"Out of nowhere, in chapter just after midway through. I stopped after three sentences, shocked, and then started laughing so hard that tears rolled down my face and my belly started hurting! ""OMG, did she just... did she really...?"" After the laughter subsided (takes a while with me), I braced my belly to finish the story, and a switch I never saw coming left me in stitches again.

2726,"My son is a big fan of ""Secret Agent Jack Stalwart"".  After finishing the entire 14 books, we found ""The Judy Moody"" collection is highly recommended by Amazon parents.  I bought one for my 6-year-old whose English is his second language and he loved it!  The collection from 1 to 9 in a box set is wonderful.  It is a little bit more difficult than ""Secret Agent Jack Stalwart"" but my son still loves it!

We're glad that the commends from other parents are true and we're happy to say it as well.  Get the complete collection!",A great collection for young readers who love spy and detective stories!
2727,This mystery was pretty predictable but the characters likeable.  And the bad guy believable.  Small town politics are the same as big city politics - just smaller!  I'd read another one in the series.  I seem to find a lot of mysteries where a blizzard or major snowstorm plows thru- I must like them!,This mystery was pretty predictable but the characters likeable
2728,Great read although a sad story - I couldn't put this book down.  It was so suspenseful and I couldn't wait to hear what would happen next.  It was that way until the very end of the book and I didn't see the ending coming at all.  I actually gasped out when I was reading.  Would highly recommend this book.,Very suspenseful read athough the story is on a very sad subject of what some children have to go through.
2729,"It's always a pleasure to read Neal Asher's books. As a hard-core science fiction writer his is tops.

2730,"I figured out one of the villains early on, but doubted myself due to aspects that became clear later.  Love this romantic suspense series with a touch of the paranormal.  This particular book did not disappoint.  Lots of suspense - some of it dark, so be aware if you don't like too many graphic details in your murder mysteries - there are a few ""ick"" scenes, though they are not gratuitous.  The romance moves a little fast, but given the situation the characters are thrown in, it is believable.  Recommended","Good romantic mystery/suspense, with a touch of the paranormal"
2731,"Wish I had read The Hobbit first before reading the Lord of the Rings triology books or watching the movies.
The Lord of the Rings triology books  and movies would have been so much easier to follow and appreciate.

The Kindle version of The Hobbit allowed me to zoom in on the maps and pictures (using the View Notes & Marks feature of the Kindle), easily toggling back and forth from where I was reading along in the book.  I was surprised how easy it was using the Kindle book version...easier than trying to flip back and forth using a paper back book version.",Must read before indulging the Lord of the Rings Triology books or movies

Definitely grammar and spelling mistakes throughout her books which made me pause in my reading BUT pause doesn't mean stop. I will read more of Angel White, typos and all if she'd only hurry on book 8. One of the most enjoyable series I've read in a while.

He blends a good biographer's knack for meticulous research and justified insights with his honed skill in writing briskly, with immediacy.  The result is a striking, lyrical narrative warranting placement of this book on the shelf along-side other best books on FDR and the end of WWII.",Masterful and Essential to Further Understanding of FDR and Last Days of War
2736,"Very enjoyable. A theological and philosophical look at George Washington. I greatly appreciated this. Clearly the writers have studied Washington in depth. Not only frequent references to the other leaders and writers of the time, which is typical and expected, the writers clearly studied those books, writings and bios to share how these shaped his religious thoughts and beliefs. I learned a great deal more of Washington than I had expected. Worthwhile read for those that enjoy studying our first President.",Enjoyable. Fills a gap missing from most bio's of George Washington.
2737,"David Saperstein Novel version which made into a successful 1985 film develops a bit differently from movie script. This novel does not have a grandchild of one of the senior characters, David performed by Barret Oliver (best known by Never Ending Story). The film's protagonist Jack in this novel has a girlfriend and Jack and the female Antareans will never develop into love romance. Even with some discrepancies I enjoyed this novel quite a lot.

I should say that I have big, strapping, burly, tough boys, who also have very tender hearts.  They really, really loved the messages in this book.  We still talk about it months later on occasion, when there is something stressful going on.  I'm glad we have this book around.","... a bit on the older side for a book like this, but I was wrong"
2739,"I love the idea of this book, and the content is pretty good and impressive! However, I wish the editor would have caught more of the typos, as for me it's a bit distracting. Also, I'm not a fan of the social media prompts at the middle of each devotion. It brings my mind back to social media, which I want to escape when I'm praying and drawing closer to the Lord. It's not a good fit for me, but I know it's a wonderful devotional for others. Give it a try to see if you like it.","Pretty good, but a bit distracting with the social media prompts throughout."

After being severely wounded, LT Redmon and his family had to endure endless surgeries in an effort to repair the physical injuries. Along with those issues, the mental agony at times seemed to be almost as difficult. Redmon used his determination to overcome his shortcomings in the early years, due in large part to being mentored by truly great leaders and the love of a devoted wife.

Wound in with much local color in and around the Twin Cities, this homicide piece shows who did it early on while leading readers on an extensive journey toward how the bad guys will be caught, which is never in doubt.  If you're more interested in a thriller where the crimes unfold in a surprising way in Europe and along the Eastern Seaboard and who wins is unknown until final pages, try ""Goshawk"" by Doug McPheters",Great Detective Novel but not as Surprising or Exciting as Goshawk by Doug McPheters

I would recommend The Human Forged to anyone who enjoys novels that are at the intersection of thrillers and science fiction.",The Human Forged was a great ride from the beginning to the end

I do not give five stars because, although the story is nice, I do not like the writing style which is closer to a movie script than to literature. I prefer to distinguish them. Both are nice, but each one has its own place.

I am not sure to continue reading the continuation, but I do not discard it.",Nice but thought for a movie script rather than for literature.

This book is beautiful, and has plenty of information about the game!","Whether you need tips or a new collectors item for your bookshelf, this is the product for you!"
2752,This book started out interesting simply because it is a topic that isn't really talked about. I got it because I'm a fan of natural remedies and the book wasted no time telling me how reflexology relates to natural pain relief. But then it proceeded to telling tips and strategies and practicing it. Then it ended a bit sooner than I expected.

Even with the high price of fruits and veggies, these concoctions should save money over commercial products.

I didn't want to put it down,  both to see how everything connected, and also because I might lose the thread of the story and have to do some rereading. Some characters were a little stereotypical (the good thief, the big guy with a good heart), but Dr. Leonard was unique and believable. Great potential for a movie here.","Bought for the story, but really liked the cast of characters"

Carr also shared a sensitive and informative look into the everyday lives of the mentally challenged.  i  found that the exploration of surrogacy, adoption and struggles to overcome the loss of a woman's ability to reproduce were all dealt with authentically and with great compassion.  As usual, I loved the way Carr developed the male perspectives and dialogues with the women in their lives.

2761,"A 3-star plot with 5-star writing equals 4-stars. Grisham can write! To me at least, the plot seemed more than a bit far-stretched. But since almost all novelists get their ideas from somewhere near the truth, someday I will discover that such a plot really happened.
In any case, irrespective of what I found far fetched, I enjoyed reading Grisham's superb writing.","Even with my 4-Star rating, I agree with the 1-Star & 2-Star posters comments."

I really liked this story about a bad guy in war with corrupt federal agents and drug cartels.
The writing sucked me in.
The constellation of a crocked brother taking the place of his cop brother was handled very well in my opinion, since there were many people who saw this, but had their own motives to keep it secret.

2770,"..between chapters.

This is classic Reacher, with some twists that I loved.

How he finds such perverted people in the most innocuous of American cities amazes me.  And how he defeats them with no blowback always leaves me dizzy.

And often he also finds a woman with no agenda or pretense, and willing to assist or accompany or become an accomplice , usually very temporarily..  I like that Chang turned that role slightly...and now I need to know what happens next.

And as usual, our hero rides off into the sunset, someone else is left to clean up the debris.","I pretty much read this straight through, but I did manager to get some sleep .."

I mistook this recommendation for one of those and was well into it before I realized that it was a paranormal horror type story . It was nicely written , of the descriptive prose was just lovely .

The author is very heavy handed with the U.S. Government security and capability, and while I am sure he was a very competent U.S. Army Ranger Officer, the other 99.9% of the U.S. Government is not very competent, dedicated or persistent.

Each little word leads somehow into the next and you never know what is next.  Forsyth is quite funny and so this a humorous presentation of what could be rather boring, but certainly doesn't turn out that way.",Forsyth is quite funny and so this a humorous presentation of what could be rather boring
2790,"This was my fun read for the week and I really enjoyed the book.  It was fast paced and packed with characters I immediately wanted to get to know better.  I felt an instant emotional connection to Camille, the main character.  She was witty, strong, and trying to find her way. (My kinda gal) I thought Edwards did a great job of developing the emotional connection between her heroine and the hero, Julian.  It was one of those stories that I read until I just couldn't keep my eyes open!  Then I woke up early before work and finished it the next morning!  C. Johnston a.k.a.

At the end of the volume I was surprised to learn that the Boston & Sandwich factory was reborn 4 times and finally closed in 1907. Some of the later production even included making electric light bulbs. In the back of the book are details and pictures  about Edison's patent for these. Overall, the material in this is quite different from what I read in the other books.",A Guide to Sandwich Glass Kerosene Lamps and Accessories by Raymond E. Barlow & Joan E. Kaiser

2793,"Really disturbing. Hero 'defiles' (author's description) heroine. That's not romance to me. Graphic description of anal sex. No character development and not much story,  just graphic sex. The book reads like it was written by a man who has no clue what women like, want or feel and really doesn't like women but likes to degrade them.",Rapey Degrading Sex Scenes Strung Together With Bad Storytelling
2794,"Darcy and Lizzy were cruel.  I did not care if they ever became a  couple.  The both deserved each other.  I felt very sorry for Jane,  She was emotionally abused by her Papa, Aunt, Uncle and  beloved sister Lizzy.  She should run from this so call family.

The Peabody Sisters: Elizabeth, Mary, and Sophia were pioneers and catalysts for Transcendentalism, Romanticism, Unification of the Protestant Church, and much more--all without realizing it!

2796,"Wow!  At times I found myself reading faster because of the suspense. Just an incredible story. I didn't give it 5 stars for two reasons. Why the use of the ""f"" word. The author managed to tell a suspenseful story without graphic sex or violence yet had to throw that in. The greatest parts didn't have that language so it wasn't needed. Second reason: the villain at the end and those inhuman reaction just a little too much. But the character interaction and constant direction changes just were amazing. Can't wait to read more from the author despite the language.",The greatest parts didn't have that language so it wasn't needed

Not that the burgers are bad or not a good book for some inspiration and fun, but I haven't found any burger yet that is a favorite or I've made twice.  With all the burger recipes out there I would say the ones in the book are more average or standard when you can easily find better and more unique or over the top recipes searching around online.

I would highly recommend this book to any musician, regardless of experience.",Stop criticizing yourself during performances; let go into the music and trust yourself!
2799,"They're not kidding about the idiot part.  There is some interesting information in this book, but the writing is about a fifth grade level and I don't think they had an editor.

Do a little more searching and get a book or two by a better author.",Some paragraphs read like a poorly composed rough draft from an undergrad student

2803,"In this collection of short stories, the one Ive read and am reviewing is Unconventional by Aleatha Romig.

Expect the unexpected with Unconventional! This novella packed a punch and really caught me off guard. I was reading, then all of a sudden we got that twist, and it made the story all the better! I loved Erika and Victor's relationship. Their chemistry was off the charts. It had just enough twisty darkness to be an Aleatha read, but it wasn't too dark! And it was crazy hot!!!

I'm glad I haven't used any of the old-time remedies, because I could have destroyed my garden in numerous ways.  Beer, alcohol, ammonia used for house cleaning, and vinegar can all harm plants, although they are recommended for liberal use in the other books.

2806,"Plum Johnson's book is fantastic, I had a problem putting it down! It reminds all of us of our mortality and the bonds of family that are not always threaded together as we would hope. The book will make you cry, laugh, cheer and it is an honest and compelling read.

I think if anything for me it reminded me that time moves faster then we would all expect and because of that  it helps to have understanding with the family and friends you have along the way. In short it made me think and realize that who we are are often pieces of other people, especially those that raised us.",We never see things as they are... we see them as we are  (anais nin)

2808,"This was an enjoyable book and it's tempting to give it 5 starts because I was pretty hooked on it, but if I gave this 5 stars...what would I give books like Uncle Tom's Cabin, Grapes of Wrath, Hunger Games, etc.  So...this is not a mind blowing book, but a pretty darn good one.  I don't get the title or the cover though.  I don't think they are a good fit for the actual story.

2812,"I often heard about people saying that an emotional intelligent person is better than having a high IQ.  I agree.  Reading this book made me realize that it is okay to be sensitive.  It is okay to get in touch with our emotional side and be vulnerable.  On the other hand, I do not want to be very vulnerable that others can take advantage of me because of it.

2815,This was the first Adriani Trigiani book that I read and I thought it was excellent. It covers several decades and shows what life was like for Italian immigrants starting at the turn of the century. The next one that I read was the more recent THE SHOEMAKER'S WIFE which I VERY HIGHLY recommend although it is a bit lengthy which is a plus for me. I am struggling a little getting into Big Stone Gap since it seems so different so far but will muster ahead a little further in it since it was recommended to me also.,Very unusual book about the turn of the century immigrants. Excellent story.

I could just imagine this really happening some day.  I really enjoyed this book and had trouble putting it down every night.  There were no typo's, misspelled words or words run together like you see in so many books.

2818,Incredible story.  Before reading it I was like every other American kid who learned about the Panama canal in history class.  i.e. the French tried and failed but the U.S. being of stouter stuff was successful.

This book is aimed towards beginners, but lays out fundamentals that can't be overlooked by even the most seasoned investor.

If you are a beginner, this is a great book, as the fundamentals are laid out in easy to understand ways, and can get you investing intelligently.","Great Book for Beginners, Nice Refresher for Seasoned Investors"
2822,"I will miss Hy Conrad.  I thought the last 2 Monk books were so much better than preceding ones.  I especially enjoyed ""Mr. Monk and the New Lieutenant"", and felt this was the best one yet.  This author did not make Monk seem so ""quirky"" which pleased me.

2823,"An excellent book. Mercifully short.  Provides cogent argument that the US is not declining in influence vis-a-vis Russia, China, Europe, Brazil, and is likely to remain the world's most powerful nation for the next few decades and probably more.  A refreshing alternative to the pervasive American ""decline-ism"" that periodically sweeps across our army of tongue-wagging media commentators.

Unfortunately the sparkling ones do tend to contrast highly against the few which are somewhat dull.

2825,"Wow!

Christian is a real Hero. ( I loved him in the first book) He seemed more human and prone to mistakes with Adera, his life and his brotherhood friends. He is the more humble and forgiving of their group.

My only complaint is that it ended without telling us what happened to Benedict Arnold. He lived until 1801, and I would have liked to have known more about how his betrayal affected the rest of his life. That omission aside, I highly recommend it.",First rate in all respects (just wish there was a chapter on Arnold's life after the betrayal)

I don't need my teens reading books with so much foul language in them when there are so many great books out there to read. I'm glad I previewed this book before buying it.

2830,Some info that will appeal to football supporters especially those Utd fans. However there is a tendency to over emphasise the skillset of Sir Alex Ferguson with that  neede by those in industry & other professionals. No doubt Sir Alex has leadership qualities but I believe its an indulgence to compare him to those who require leadership skills for more crucial & lifechanging roles!,"Sir Alex led, no doubt but a wee bit of a self indulgent read."
2831,"Interesting concept. Many, many surprises in store for readers. I read the first in the series and then immediately went for the next one. Best of the last hundred or so ebooks I've read.

This book sets out to tell the tale of the forgotten most unknown of Rosetti's models, Alexa Wilding. It however, strays quite far from even the few known facts. It then adds a great deal of flowery prose. The characters were not engaging to me. Time passed and yet characters were unchanged despite events that could cause growth.

I like all her fans,  will be sad to see it end. I highly recommend the Gender series. I love a book that brings to life a world of action, suspense, excitement, love, and loyalty.

2837,"I chose this rating because I like historical novels.  I like the way Sue Monk Kidd writes.  I especially liked the not-so-subtle interplay between slave ""ownership"" and ""ownership"" of females.

2838,"Excellent read! If it were a chocolate chip cookie it was generous with the chips while not being too big to stick in a glass of cold milk. i was  intimidated about reading StThomas Acquinas so this book came at the right time.

My only criticism is that there are constant numbers of the dead being thrown in.  Some of that is important but it interfered with my enjoyment of the book.  It is a time line of the Stalin and Hitler years.  Very interesting facts I did not know were revealed.  Gave me some further knowledge of how these two men operated and how they managed to do what they did and their interaction with each other.

Written in very plain language, easy to read with very straight forward examples.  As with all sales books I find that you will not use the prescribed system in its entirety but rather you will end up taking a handful of sound bites and advice with you to your meetings.

2854,I had no clue what to expect.  I just wanted to know if my Pastor is Spirit led.  Was I blown away.  My eyes were opened. I did not know I needed to learn how to breath in this way!  I don't want to be just living but live a Life for God by becoming more Christlike through the help of the Holy Spirit.  I could not put the book down. Wow.... Amazing! Now I'm reading it again to refresh memory. Dr. Jim Mindling is a great teacher and I'm thankful God blessed me to have him as my Pastor.,I could not put the book down. I've read it 2 times and handed out many hard copies.
2855,"I have been listening to Alex Theis' Limitless podcast since its inception and learn something valuable with every episode. Now, to have the best of the best of this podcast culled down and compiled into this book, is extraordinary. Start at the beginning to ""Rewire your Limiting Beliefs"" or jump to the middle and read how to ""Empower Others"", or open the book at any page. You are guaranteed to both be inspired and have one more effective tool to help you become a Limitless Leader. Can't get enough of this writer/podcaster's work!","This goes way beyond ""25 ways"" to become a leader - professionally and in life. Such an inspiring (and quick) read!"
2856,"Such an entertaining story and I look forward to the rest of the books.  Satan & Death as buddies, fictional characters brought to life.  This is such a wonderful escape from reality it was hard to put down.  Love this author and look forward to what other fanciful characters and situations he puts them in.",This is such a wonderful escape from reality it was hard to put down
2857,"If you like strong female characters, shape shifting, and romance in new (but believable) worlds, you will find yourself caught up in Charlotte Abel's web. It's been the first book in a while that has kept me up at night reading. I can't tell you much about the book without giving away the twists and turns, because they abound on every page - without getting unbelievable or confusing. As soon as I read the last page, I was googling Charlotte Abel to buy the next book in the series. (That was my only disappointment - I have to wait for the next book!)",Looked for next book in series as soon as I turned the last page
2858,"I purchased this title because I very much enjoyed Goldsmith's book, The Bestseller, which I would recommend buying--but not this one. The author's technique here seems to be Don't Use 50 Words When You Can Drag It Out to 500 or more. Lordy, does she beat everything to death! I struggled through 30% of the alternating wives' stories (all tedious and predictable, by the way) and called it a day. Waaaayyyyy too much blah blah blah.",I purchased this title because I very much enjoyed Goldsmith's book
2859,"This book is very helpful for both pastors and laypersons alike.  It gives one the tools to consider carefully the use of exegetical methods which are misused often.  It is by far the shortest and most useful book regarding its topic, but it is also chock full of examples that help you to see how Scripture gets distorted (often unknowingly) by pastors and laity.",It is by far the shortest and most useful book regarding its topic
2860,"This is my first Greg Iles novel and I have found a new favorite author. I expected a light, easy read and was very happy to find something much deeper than initially assumed.  I found myself both loving and hating certain characters and by the last chapter, very surprised that I was holding my breath.  Very good read",... Greg Iles novel and I have found a new favorite author. I expected a light
2861,"Touched my heart.  This takes place in Canton, Ohio - but could have, and probably did, happen all over the country in various forms. A frightening look at our country and its people during the depression, and the inner and outer strength it took to survive the devastating effects over which they had no control.  The kindnesses of family, friends, and complete strangers that bind us together is a message of hope and encouragement.",Outstanding look at the reality of the depression and the differnce one person's kindness can make
2862,"DH has written a SyFy novel , which in writing it, has created a political thriller and bombshell. Can you go in the past and be killed then cancel your future. Mossad is a very important cog in Israel's defense against all enemies. The organization goes to the past and attempts to guide the future. This is an excellent read for the genre..... ER",Time Travel - The Ultimate Source Of Changing the Present By Changing the Past
2863,Angel Rock Leap is an amazing story with a theme about bullying. The characters and situations were so believable. The story kept me glued to the next page -- I couldn't put it down until I found out how all of those relationships were going to resolve. It was satisfying to see the characters interact with each other and find their way through life as they learn more about themselves and react to each other.,Amazing story with a character who finds her way of dealing with a bully
2864,"From award-winning author R.A. McCandless comes the second book in the Flames of Perdition series.  Focused on Del, a tough-as-nails immortal who unwillingly works for the Throne, and Marrin, her snarky partner with a penchant for quoting movies and television shows, HELL BECOMES HER continues the page-turning action.  When Dels daughter is kidnapped by a shadowy group, Del will do anything to get her back.  She had thought there was nothing worse than angels and demons.  Del will learn how wrong she was.",She had thought there was nothing worse than angels and demons
2865,"No one, no one, no one knows more about the novel than Kundera. Maybe this isn't up to the lofty standards of Art of the Novel but it's well worth your time. You know, Kundera might just be one of the world's smartest, most observant people... someone whose writing in impeccable... whose analysis of contemporary times and the role the novel plays in showing us our lives is brilliant.",whose analysis of contemporary times and the role the novel plays in showing us our lives is brilliant.
2866,"This reminds me of ""Wild at Heart"", my least favorite of John's books. But John's worse book is better than practically any other author's best. This guy really communicates spiritual principles in my ""heart language"". He helps you believe that intimacy with God is not only possible, it's chasing you...He's chasing you!","John has an inspiring, fascinating and fresh style of communicating. He's my favorite. He gives me great encouragement."
2867,"This is an extremely well-written, thoughtful defense of democracy and why it works despite the irrationality of the ordinary voter.  It happens to reach a different conclusion than my own book, Political Animals:  How Our Stone Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics, but so be it.  It raises important issues thinking people will want to consider.","How Our Stone Age Brain Gets in the Way of Smart Politics, but so be it"
2868,"Waaaaaoooooo!!!!
This is so far the best book I have  ever read from this serie !!! THE BEST BOOK!!!!! Knowing the reason behind his behavior and  the reason why he was so cruel and heartless make me cry , I'd like to give 10 starts !!' It was extremely hard for me to put this book down. At least braith had the chance to know who his real dad was and that he wasn't a monster because he wanted to and just because he didn't have other choice  .",This is so far the best book I have ever read from this serie
2869,"Emotional, steamy, and exciting, this story is incredibly hard to put down. I immediately felt for Hero and Arturo and their sorrow. It's a touching story as these two fight to be open to love once again. The writing is flawless and characters spot on. I truly felt their pain, which speaks to the talent if the author. The characters flesh out beautifully and I came to care for them so much. An awesome read I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend. This is a voluntary review of an advance reader copy.",Emotional and Heated - A Great Romance with Strong Characters
2870,"This is a great history lesson about Jesus ministry and early Christianity. This book provides what appears to be a very scientific study of how historians have reconstructed Jesus life and the beliefs of his early followers from early writing s that were mostly anonymous and written decades after Jesus death.  For further reading, I also recommend a book with a similar title When Jesus Became God. The two books complement each other very well without much duplication of story line.",This is a great history lesson about Jesus ministry and early Christianity
2871,"Anything can happen in NOLA and for Dallas SWAT werewolf, Remy Boudreaux, that would mean forgiving himself and letting himself love again. It is going to take his nerdy high school crush, Triana Bellamy, now all grown up mother to crack through the shell around his heart to help him learn to love again. This is a high energy, fast paced sweet and sexy addition to the series and I thoroughly enjoyed every page. This book also hints at a danger to the wolves much bigger than any perp theyve encountered to date. Bring it!","This is a high energy, fast paced sweet and sexy addition to the series"
2872,"Twisted is an appropriate title for this book as this is exactly what the plot does, in so many different ways. There is however a lot more to it than this, but I refuse to be a spoiler. I just wanted to keep going until I finished it, because I had to see if I was predicting the outcomes...some I did, some I didn't. The characters were a weird and interesting bunch, mostly not very likable, but they provided endless interest.  If you are looking for something to keep you occupied over the Christmas break I can recommend this...but you probably won't be very sociable while you are reading it.",If you are looking for something to keep you occupied over the Christmas break I can recommend this.
2873,I received this product at a discount for my honest review.  My personal opinion plays more into this product.  I wasn't impressed with the recipes it suggests.  The choices were a little more fancy than I had hoped for.  If you are used to eating at finer establishments then I would recommend these recipes for you.,If you are used to eating at finer establishments then I would recommend these recipes for you
2874,"A very good and immensely readable  study of the  lives of the apostles by an authority on the subject. Superb in its vivid account of the men who followed Jesus and, after his death and resurrection,  went on to share his gospel with the world, many of them to their peril. I know of no book that details the lives of those ordinary men with such clarity and excellence of writing. I think it would make a perfect book for a church group to study and discuss.",An excellent account of those hearty souls who followed Jesus
2875,"Great Book! I found it to be quite informative as a ""How To"" on self sufficiency. Being a ""City Boy"", I never even realized how darn big one acre actually is. It is 10,800 square feet! So, a quarter of an acre is over 2,500 square feet! I would read up about a house being sold with a quarter acre of land, and I would think: ""Only a quarter of an acre? That must be pretty small."" WRONG. I would imagine that a heck of a lot of good food can be grown on a 1/4 acre, as this book so clearly points out.","A ""Must Have"" For Any Would-Be Self Sufficient Minded Green Thumber"
2876,"It's actually hard to find a quality book on hemp. Many claim to offer all sorts of history and information...nothing. Doug Fine does an amazing job of not only covering the value of hemp, but also keeping the reader interested. I highly recommend this book to EVERYONE. You don't have to be a hempster to appreciate this book, but it will make you one.","You don't have to be a hempster to appreciate this book, but expect to become one"
2877,"Although Puller's personal story was very interesting in itself, I really appreciated his assessment of the Vietnam war as a politically expedient undertaking.  It hit him personally and this book, that describes his life, speaks well for the 1000's who had and are having similar experiences as the result of serving in the Vietnam war.",You must read this to get a realistic understanding of the Vietnam war.
2878,"Jerry Newport and Mary Meinel Newport's Mozart and the Whale is an honest and engrossing account of two adults on the spectrum who meet, fall in love, and don't necessarily live happily ever after.  This affecting memoir manages to be both bluntly candid and romantic: while the Newports clearly love each other, love is not at first enough for two such complex people.  One of the most valuable contributions this book makes is its demonstration of the social and emotional learning that can go on well into adulthood, learning that makes the Newports' second try at marriage more successful.","An intelligent and thoughtful perspective on life, love, and Asperger Syndrome"
2879,"Dune, of course, is a masterpiece of science fiction literature.  Herbert was the first Tolkien of the sci-fi world.  Dune has also been reviewed to death by many others far more capable than I and there is absolutely nothing I can add to the thousands of reviews already made. If you are fan of sci-fi, Dune is a must read in order  to see where the first truly masterful beginnings of sci-fi literature started.  Sure, there were other writers who come to mind--H.G. Wells for example---but Herberts' Dune still provides a read that holds up today as well as it did when it was first written.","Dune, a masterpiece of science fiction literature: a must read for all sci-fi fans"
2880,"To be honest, my biggest hurdle in this book was that the hero was awful to Tansey. I'm all for characters not hitting it off right away or for some good old fashioned tension in the mix, but he was just plain mean. A lot. She keeps forgiving him in so many cases when I didn't think she should. Other than that--it's a big deal, too bad--it was a fun, cute book.

Content:
Sex - 1+ (passionate kissing and mild innuendo)
Language - 0? (Can't remember!)
Violence - 0
Overall rating - PG",I'm all for characters not hitting it off right away or for some good old fashioned tension in the mix
2881,"I love this book series! At first I was skeptical....alien hybrid? But it's REALLY good. The author does a GREAT job at letting us get to know the characters and we see chapters from both points of view. I loved seeing Ariane and Zane's relationship develop. It was so real. There's no insta-love, no love triangles. Just a girl trying to discover herself, win her freedom, and fall in love without feeling bad about it. Loved it! Can't wait for the third! I should also mention I'm not one for series because I usually get bored but this one has me hooked.","Loved it! Unique, depth felt characters, no insta-love or love triangle..SOLD"
2882,"I don't read a lot of fiction. I gravitate more toward pure history and theology. When I do venture toward fiction, it's normally something like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy that catches my attention, not Tolkien or Lewis. All of that is to say that I didn't know how I would enjoy The Seed: A True Myth. What surprise when, only two chapters into it, my heart rate started to rise as I fell into the world created by Guzman. A great storyteller helps us understand our own stories. By that and any other measure, Erik Guzman is a great storyteller. Highly recommended!",it's normally something like John Steinbeck or Cormac McCarthy that catches my attention
2883,"Stop what you are doing and go and get this book NOW!!!!! Words cannot describe how much this story touched my heart. I could not imagine being the mom in this story and what to do in her situation. Jodi Picoult did such an amazing job with this well written book, it made me wonder what all she has gone through with dealing with people with Autism or Asperger's Syndrome. This book would be an amazing book for anyone to read. It really brings awareness to the autistic community and also what it might feel like to be in a person's shoes with Asperger's.",Jodi Picoult did such an amazing job with this well written book
2884,"I don't think I could add much to the reviews. This is a marvelous work, and a good antidote to the more common ""newage"" (rhymes with ""sewage"") books churned out by the thousands on the beliefs of the pre-Christian inhabitants of the British Isles. MAKE your neo-pagan friends read this! Tie them down and read it to them if you have to!","If you're a neo-pagan, you won't be after reading this (if you have any sense)"
2885,"Loved this collection! All four authors were new to me and I wasn't disappointed. There's some new talent here that I'll be watching for new books from. Especially Louisa Cornell. But all the stories were simply delightful. I loved the light intrigue and the fun Regency era romps. :) Couldn't have spent my Christmas better by reading this delightful collection! For regency lovers and historical fans, this is a must-read for your to-be-read pile.","Fun, historical romp, a must-read for all Regency romance lovers!"
2886,"What can I possibly say about Brothel that hasn't already been said? Everything about this Bram Stoker-winning collection was perfect. The theme, tone, order of poems, emotion elicited, I absolutely devoured the one-hundred fifty-four poems over three nights, and would stumble across a new 'favorite' every other poem. I will definitely be picking up a copy of An Exorcism of Angels and Hysteria: A Collection of Madness, as well as Stephanie's Bram Stoker-nominated debut novel, The Eighth.",Everything about this Bram Stoker-winning collection was perfect.

2887,"I first visited Berlin in 1958, before the wall. I next visited in 2014, many years after the fall of East Germany and the wall. What a beautiful city and I am proud to have experienced the city before and after the wall. Do visit this wonderful city and try and imagine what it was like to live in the East during those terrible years.",A wonderful insight into the lives of those who lived in East Germany.
2888,I really enjoyed reading Nina and Griffin's story.  There are a lot of great moments in there - some of all the feels!  The character of Kenny is hilarious and I think he needs his own story with his bf. What a truly great book to read.  I definitely recommend this one.  I read this book as an ARC and this is my honest review.,A great book with all of the feels!  Another hit for Summer Cooper!
2889,"We will be transitioning our little one into a big boy this weekend. Stories, and especially bedtime stories, are an important part of our daily lives. We let him pick out Elmo sheets for his new bed and I wanted to find a book that would help him understand the big change in a way that made it fun and exciting. I came across this book on a blog and ordered it right away. We've been reading it for a couple days now and it's totally working! He goes into his room and says, ""Elmo Big Bed?"" (He's 22 months old). Perfect! Love it and highly recommend it!",the PERFECT book to help transition your little toddler into a big kid bed!
2890,"The Hobbit is amazing, hands down, so I don't need to review the story.  This lovely version illustrated by Jemima Catlin is a treasure, and we will keep it forever.  The pictures are not scary, occur very frequently throughout the story, and absolutely elevated the reading experience for my five year old.  100% recommend.",This lovely version illustrated by Jemima Catlin is a treasure
2891,"The concepts are mind blowing from classical physics, but presentation conservative and reasonable. This is where the best minds are going, but the difficulty is mine. Thseries of books that deal with these conclusions from quantum physics will develop the major thrust of Religion in this new century.

This all started a hundred years ago and is just now starting to blend into the conversation.

weymouth fogelberg",Careful and intelligent description of science and spirituality. Beautiful writer. Part of my quest.
2892,"Not up to the quality of the original book. Seemed to me like it wallowed at times in defensive self justification in regard to the effect of the decision to leave the cult and the effect on the children, particularly the oldest girl. In a few places read almost like a psycho babble journal rather than an objective recounting. That said, who can say what is objective for one who has undergone such a horrible experience.
I certainly enjoyed reading the book, but my overall impression was somewhat less favorable than it was for the initial book.",Good book but not up to the level of the initial book by Jessop.
2893,"Fifty Cents and a Dream: Young Booker T. Washington (Hardcover)
by Jabari Asim
a poetic look at the life of Booker t Washington from slavery to freedom, from dream to learning, it also lists the events in his life and how they affected him. a great book for cultural understanding with american history, great presentation with good pictures, and helps kids relate to the struggles of freedom, tolerance, and personal goals.",a great book for cultural understanding with american history
2894,"Loved it from beginning to end.

This should be a movie and probably will. I've been telling people about it since I read it.

Not giving any ""spoilers"" but near the end you will be pleasantly surprised. DON'T PEEK.

It will remind you of the day we all watched the Berlin Wall coming down.

This will show younger people how your entire life can change from one small act.","Raed it in 2 days, and I want to go back and read it again! Movie please!!"
2895,"Taking the reader on a journey from early young womanhood through the retirement age, the author seeks to illustrate the importance of a woman's role. There is a strong Christian component to the narrative. However it is an engaging journey that brings the reader to a place that can reject the feminist narratives we are force-fed and recognize that all paths have value.

Highly recommended. I'm inspired to find the author's previous books to add to my library.",I'm inspired to find the author's previous books to add to my library.
2896,"But there is something -the tone, perhaps- that made it difficult for me to keep reading.  I even skipped around, hoping the book would grab me at some point.  No luck.  I gave up and luckily could still return if on Kindle.  If you are looking for a masterful account of Franklin's life, keep looking.  This one has many detail, but seems a bit of a lightweight in dealing with the subject.  Franklin never comes alive.  I have eclectic tastes and can read most books.  But not this one.","Lots of detail, but lost stars because it didn't tell his story very well"
2897,"Jenny Ruhl deserves a lot of credit for putting all the information out where others can get access to it.  This is largely the content of her website, but is better organized for book format.

Jenny digs into the science and is an excellent researcher - I actually referred my doctor to stuff she had posted links to, and he thanked me for helping him learn more about diabetes.

If you or a loved one has diabetes, get this book.  If you're concerned about pre-diabetes, get this book.  Aimed at both insulin dependent, and non-insulin dependent, it is a great source of information.","If You Have Diabetes, If a Loved One Does, or if You're Just Concerned, Get This Book!"
2898,"Though I learned some things in here, it went a bit deeper than I had wanted. Overall very informative if you know nothing about bio identical hormones. It also explains a lot about menopause and the help the bioidentical hormones can be.

I'd recommend it to any woman who needs hormone treatment or has a hormone imbalance. You can learn a lot about the importance of the natural with no side effects, opposed to the synthetics with major ones. It explains the great benefits men and women can get more naturally.",Informative Information on the Benefits of more Natural Hormones!
2899,"Riveting true story-about  innocent black citizens in the South electrocuted for crimes they often did not commit. In addition they had sloppy and  incompetent defenseand no one to turn to for help. Fortunately the author has a passion to bring this to light and over time was able to convince others to join him.

2900,"I have read many books and articles on Amelia Earhart's life and final end.  This book does not review Amelia's life but chronicles all of the facts pertaining to that fatal last flight including the planning, the flight as it happened, and all of the facts pertaining to her disappearance and subsequent search efforts. I was impressed with the Author's documented details that provided a slight change of view of the Amelia I thought I knew as well as the miscommunications and other errors that served to, ultimately, be her undoing.",Great read with new information concerning Amelia's Disappearance.
2901,"I don't get all the whining about either the Italian scenery or the language. I could not put this down, enjoyed every character and locale, and found the plot up to George's usual excellent standard. I pre-ordered the book but almost didn't bother reading it after all the vitriol heaped on it. Glad I decided to forge ahead. What Italian there is is usually explained in the context or otherwise. Personally I liked the change of scenery and culture.","Don't be put off by the low reviews, this is another great book in this series"
2902,"I was a  disappointed with the number of words in this big book.  I loves James Patterson and Bill O'Reilly and thought I would get one for my grandchildren. The concept of the book is great but I was disappointed with the content.  I was expecting  book with more words, considering the price I had to pay for it.",I was a disappointed with the number of words in this big book
2903,"This is a story of castes, culture, and poverty on a space station. It is definitely a new bend on any sci-fi that I have read. The author really put care and detail into her characters. The future of Indonesian culture, I would never have even thought about it.

To be honest, when I got through the first few chapters, I thought the plot was moving too slowly. However, that would have been regretful. It was a great story and I've bought the next book.",Intriguing story of rising above one's caste on a space station
2904,"I received an ARC for Sleeping with the Enemy by Tia Siren and for just that one story alone it's worth the cost of the set.  The story has a blend of mystery, intrigue, suspense along with some intense chemistry between two characters brought together  by the death of a brother/employee.  It's a quick and easy read with some very sexy scenes but also some heartfelt ones as well.  Haven't read any of the other stories in the set, but again this one alone makes the $.99 cost worth it.  I am voluntarily leaving a review.",The price of the set is worth it for even just one of the stories.

Ominously, Anya has been called to the aid of Alex on the anniversary of her daughter's suicide.  In this harrowing book, Anya struggles with the demons that Alex sees while second guessing the hallucinations that her daughter had told to her.  This book engages the dealer in that deepest of fears, can our souls be pursued by demons?  In the very real pain of schizophrenia, what would the answer mean?","""The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heav'n of hell, a hell of heav'n"""
2906,"I hear a book when I read it ... the cadence of the pace, rhythm, and flow; the reality of the dialog; the singing of syllables; the poetry of descriptive drama and action. I find all these elements in this ""Mysteries"" series. I do so hope author Carole Lawrence continues with the salvation and redemption of ""Ian Hamilton"" with his family, friends, and colorful associates.","Great Plot, characterization, and most important to me--the symphony of the written word!"
2907,"Very interestingly from a historical point of view but boring at times because the story and deception become clear in the middle of the book. Afterwards it reads more like a log of a court hearing. Not the author's fault, because he did a very accurate job in researching the history, but turns the book sluggish nevertheless.",Very well researched book but history unfortunately isn't always exciting from the first to last page
2908,"This is not a book about dreamy ways to do better.  This book describes how a disfunctional team became a functional team that acdtually got things done.  This book is about how to focus on the right things and execute on the vision.  I also suggest that you get the book Traction, by the same author and The Advantage by Patrick Lencioni.  They go together like peas and carrots.",If you want to make progress in your business life you need to read this book.
2909,"This book promotes an approach to coaching derived from ""life coaching"" and is not appropriate for the professional development of educators.  While it includes some useful elements, it is overly complex, and assumes that becoming an effective teacher is a matter of self-discovery, rather than a profession grounded in research, standards, and rigor that can be learned and practiced. The authors fail to address issues of race and equity.  There is much better stuff out there.","An approach to coaching derived from ""life coaching"" not appropriate for the professional development of educators"
2910,"I've been a J.A. Jance fan since the start of her Seattle Detective J.P. Beaumont series [I'm now a fan of the Johanna Brady series].

2911,"I tried to read this book, but I felt like I needed to interpret the French language better to be able to get through it. There was just too much French language without the usual English interpretation with it, as you see other authors thoughtfully do. I am an avid reader of Christian Historical Fiction and I understand French some, but it was just too much. The cover was beautiful and initially drew me to the book, but hence the saying goes and reversely applies to this book....""you can't judge a book by it's cover.""",You'll probably want to take a Intermediate to Advanced French Class before reading this book!
2912,"Reading anything by Bret Easton Ellis is an emotional trip.  Not just for the work...which is always captivating...but because the prose is so well done that you don't want it to end.  It always reminds me of a fine dining experience with good friends from out of town.  No matter how wonderful I know it will be, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that after this amazing experience...I won't see them again for some time.",It always reminds me of a fine dining experience with good friends from out of town
2913,"The story begins with the main character punching out a superior officer (albeit an inferior human being). And the first half of the book provides some convincing action and great characters. The second half was pure awesome.
I especially appreciated the way one of the characters was provided an opportunity for redemption, regardless of the personal cost. For me, there was no downside to purchasing this novel. And J. G. Cressy is on my short list of authors to follow.",The earth is destroyed by the aliens who have taken over the other aliens

Hopefully, the EM drive will evolve to be as cool as it is in this book and my kid's generation will make it to Mars, even though my generation did not!","If you like kick-ass female heroes and cute robots, suspense, and evil corp villains, this book is for you!"
2917,"I enjoyed this book as it brought things closer to home and today's issues. Also it gave a closer look at Nathan's relationship with his father and Holly. Harvey took a different role this time as shooter instead of spotter, and brought back familiar face of Grangeland. Was a enjoy reading and look forward to the next book.","A good book, different view into Nathan's life. Enjoyed reading it."
2918,"Great book!  Well written, with an easy flow and important facts and details of one of America's most historical events. A must read for any one interested in American military history. The author delivered on an important promise, giving credit to all who made that mission work. Once I started it, I did not want to put it down until I finished it.",A must read for any one interested in American military history.
2919,"For a book it was okay. The ending was some what of a let down, happened to fast. Although Rachel figured out what was going on between the deceased the and culprit there was no/know coherence. That may be the wrong usage of the word. When I saw the previews of the upcoming movie I thought perhaps the movie might be better then the book. But now I do not think so.",When I saw the previews of the upcoming movie I thought perhaps the movie might be better then the book
2920,"Very interesting first-person (and some second-person, from her father) account of the events in Czechoslovakia before, during, and immediately after WWII.  If you haven't delved more deeply than most Americans into Czechoslovakian history, you'll likely learn a good deal and come to a fuller appreciation of the plight of this land.  Fascinating to hear it told by someone who was closely connected with key figures.",Fascinating account of lesser known history (for most Americans)
2921,"I sat down and read this book the moment it arrived. Each time I get a new cookbook, I sit down and mark the recipes I want to try. I don't always get the opportunity to try all that I mark, but I will with the ones I marked in this book. We have tried a few of them so far--especially Mitt's favorite meatloaf--and plan to try even more.

The stories about the family and the family life of the Romney clan made this cookbook all the more enjoyable. THIS is the woman who should have been our First Lady.",Great recipes and wonderful peek into the lives of the Romney family.
2922,"A really good read, plenty for us techies to absorb, great characterization , and tackled in a unique self narrated/daily log perspective that works really well. Others have complained about bad language use but it seems to me that it fits right in, is entirely justified and even enhances the story. And it's not as prevalent as others make it out to be.. I'm sure real astronauts swear too.

Really enjoyed the book it was one I had difficulty putting done... Now... Next book please Andy.","Am excellent, thrilling and funny exploration of the left behind on Mars topic"
2923,"The upside: an easily understood application of family systems theory for church leaders.  The downside: it takes family systems theory too uncritically, and isn't clear enough (self-differentiation?) between this book and the earlier Friedman and Steinke corpus.  If you've not read that material, this is a good place to start.",Uncritical application of family systems theory to church leadership
2924,"Beautiful, lovely, tender... savage, brutal, bleak. Kushiel's Justice walks the line and finds the right balance. Fans of Jacqueline Carey's other works in the Kushiel's series will feel satisfied with how Carey continues to develop the character of Imriel de la Courcel. This is one hero whose journey is at times moving, at times painful to witness, always very real and engrossing. Carey doesn't shy away from anything. Is it impossible to not fall in love with the characters of this story? It was for this reader.",Kushiel's Justice May Break Your Heart (and you'll love every minute of it!)
2925,"So many teaching books make teachers out to be complete martyrs, or make elementary teaching out to be nothing but adorable children doing adorable things. This book does a great job of bridging the gap- sharing cute anecdotes and memorable moments that show the impact of a teacher, but also the bittersweet moments and tough calls that make it so challenging. Plain and simple, Matt GETS it! A great, quick read for any teacher to feel inspired and refreshed- or for anyone who wants a glimpse into a day in the life of a teacher.",Heartwarming Glimpse Into the Sweet and Difficult Job of Teaching
2926,"As a devotee of the blog this book is based on, I'm looking forward to my daily dose of a new photo from this calendar.  I've actually practiced self-restraint and haven't looked ahead! Even my husband has become a devotee of the crazy photos Andy Donaldson collects and displays for our entertainment, with wonderful little comments that really make the whole thing laugh-out-loud funny.  I expect to be laughing daily in 2016!",A calendar for anyone who is mystified by photos included in real estate listings
2927,"An unusual book which provides glimpses into the lives of Japanese girls who came to the US as brides for Japanese men already here...it points out the many disappointments and experiences of young foreign ladies in an alien land.  Then WWII comes along and these women along with their families are swept into the  ""round-up"" of Japanese families into the interment camps which brought untold suffering and hardship.","Japanese Women experience a new life, totally unlike what they envisioned"
2928,"Martin Ford makes a cohesive argument for automation contributing substantially to a downward economic spiral for the non-elite actors in the US (and world) economy.  In concert with political decisions made over the last 40 years accelerating automation threatens us with (mounting and accelerating) deflationary pressure.  Ford also discusses potential solutions, the most promising of which is a basic or guaranteed income.  His arguments are cogent and well thought out, he provides ample evidence for his proposals and analysis.",Well researched and thought out.... now how do we create the political will for the proposed changes.
2929,"I really like Penn Jillette as a performer and public speaker, but as a writer, he leaves a lot to be desired. His prose is exactly like his spoken commentary, so it rambles and I was often left wondering how most of the stories related at all to atheism.
If you're interested in Hollywood misadventures or Penn Jillette's personal life, it's remotely amusing, but if you're really interested in atheism, Christopher Hitchens or Sam Harris would be better investments.",I really like Penn Jillette as a performer and public speaker
2930,"Even as an active duty US Soldier, I was not prepared for what this book discusses. The stories, interviews and accounts from Ann Jones' travels around are eye-opening, riveting and continual page turners. While I wouldn't recommend this book to someone with a weak stomach, maybe that's exactly what Americans need to read -- a heart-wrenching account of the sacrifices made by US service members. This book does a great job following the Soldiers from injury to family. A must read for political science fans, military history fans and medical fans.",An eye-opening look at the true story behind America's wounded warriors
2931,"Having read up a lot on Scientology due to friends previous involvement, this is the most compelling story. Candid, honest and helps you understand how people get and stay trapped by this cult.

So brave!"

2933,"This was an essential piece of learning for me as a developing writer, and I have already implemented the information in this book into my writing, with superior results. I had been hovering too much over my scenes, leaving too much distance between my stories and my readers. With the instructions provided in this book, I now have an easy-to-check list of things to do to ensure the narrative distance is minimal, and my readers can really engross themselves in my stories without being yanked out of the scene by too much narrative distance. Thanks Ms. Nelson!",An excellent guide that will bring writing quality up a significant notch in no time at all.
2934,"If one is going to read this book I would highly recommend starting the series at the beginning. The character development is ongoing and knowing the relationships is very beneficial to the enjoyment. That said, it can be read as a stand alone novel. Beware you will want to back step to the first book forward.",... is going to read this book I would highly recommend starting the series at the beginning
2935,"Fun, action-oriented murder mystery with comic-book appeal having a large cast of unique characters containing a wide range of incredible skills. I really enjoyed the book for it's tongue-in-cheek manner for example when describing a setting such as ""Henchmen's isn't your typical watering hole. It was founded way back by Dastard Lee (dastardly) as a place exclusively for black capes."" Just a wild, no-holds barred book, and leave you with one final passage to pique your interest, ""What the city needed was a hero.

2936,I had real high hopes for this from the description and reviews but unfortunately I was just unable to get past 3%.  I like to have something intrigue me right out of the gate and this did not happen.  The writing was an odd style that I just could not overcome.  It was in the first person but the tense was odd.,Difficult Reading - Unable to get me into the characters / plot

2939,"If every comics publisher was pushing new volumes of Mutt and Jeff strips, I'd probably rate this book a little lower because it jumps around in time, it's not annotated, and there are a few mistakes (one strip appears again on the next page).

But since there are no other volumes - this is a rare, beautiful gem of glory.  The drawings are brilliant.  The gags and continuity (when not un-done by the editor of this volume) are genius.

There's a reason why Bud Fisher was one of the richest comic artists of all time.

2940,"Nick and his band of crusader-heroes face daunting odds to defeat a power-hungry psychopath and a ruthless jihadist. The blend of technology, science and ethics is compelling and the action and intrigue is mesmerizing. Although I recognized the deception of a lead character, the ending is satifying. The epilogue is a masterful way to set up another book with the reader cheering for the good guys. I enjoyed the understated, non graphic romantic scenes as much as the action scenes. This author is as talented as Crichton! I will read the rest of his work soon.","Intrepid good guys vanquish evil terrorists, corrupt politician and deceive Victor"
2941,"Well written as always. A bit tedios, no explosive action and the plot is rather predictable. The detective work is in the main role and slowly but inevitably Reacher  catches the bad guys. The book is good reading, enjoyable and interesting, but it could have been better, considering the author's abilities.",The detective work is in the main role and slowly but inevitably Reacher catches the bad guys. The book is good reading
2942,"On the contrary, I find Theodore DeBry's wonderful 1590 engravings after John White much more animated and, unlike White's watercolours, placed within the context of their surroundings. However, DeBry did take some liberties when interpreting White's ethnographic studies.  This book also includes White's 1580s wc studies of animals and plants of the Carolinas. A wonderful addition to an art or early American studies library.",Some of the earliest ethnographic prints as well as wonderful watercolors!

Then you break your fingernails trying to crawl back out.
2944,"Set in post-WW II Europe, the author has been careful to capture what it was like to live in Europe in the 1950s.  He avoids, in my opinion, preaching ""Communism bad - Democracy good"" and focuses, instead, on what daily lives of average persons were like. I liked this enough to buy a couple other books by this author and, after reading those, to by them all.  I love the history s much as the stories.  AND, I have NOT received discounts or otherwise been compromised in exchange for a favorable review - a practice I find abhorrent.  Amazon, are you reading this?",Author realistically captures what life was like in post-WW II AND tells a good spy story.
2945,"I wasn't  starting the book until my vacation started ......just thought I would read a few pages, then I could not put the book down. I own the whole series and love how John Sandford keeps us entertained. The last Virgil book I thought was boring. It took me forever to get through it. Maybe Lucas can get Virgil a new job. I miss some of the conversations with the old ""gang"". But I love the new people Lucas comes in contact with. I highly recommend this book. It is like cuddling up with an old friend and enjoying the ride.",I own the whole series and love how John Sandford keeps us entertained
2946,"I read this marvellous tale by buying five different volumes, totalling nearly 700 pages, one book at a time.  You won't have to do that.  If you aren't already familiar with this author's work, try it out by simply getting volume 1 - it's probably still free on Amazon, and see what you think.  I'll bet you won't regret it!

2947,"As a fan of Downton Abbey I thought this had to be bad, why use this title.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the characters who immediately come to life. Downton Abbey is only a small part of this book, the characters and their charm and sudden turns and twists found me me a bit bored with Downton Abbey and wishing this was on screen.  And hopefully it will be.  I recommend it.","... of Downton Abbey I thought this had to be bad, why use this title"
2948,"Levon Helm was there at the beginning of Rock N Roll, and with it for its first 50 years.  He's got a lot of stories about his time growing up in the Arkansas Delta, love of music, his time playing with Ronnie Hawkins, Bob Dylan, and the Band.  And the good, the bad, and the in-between of the Rock N Roll musician's lifestyle.  A good read!",Interesting read by a guy who was there at the beginning of Rock N Roll!
2949,"What the heck does the title have to do with the book, anyway?
I never quite found out. But it doesn't matter.
Rhapsodic is a wholly immersive story that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. The way the author deftly maneuvers the reader between the past and present of the main character's lifeand all in first-person without I-ing and me-ing you to deathis nothing short of brilliant.
The complex and beautiful relationship between the male and female leads unravels with the perfect amount of anticipation and the payoff is entirely satisfying.
Cannot wait to read the next one!","What the heck does the title have to do with the book, anyway?"
2950,"Downright dull & guarded. Just like Tony Iommi, he doesn't have a bad word to say about anyone --- and that's just hiding things under the carpet, it's not because he doesn't have any negative opinions. Total waste of time, this book. Too afraid of offending anyone. Too afraid to tell tales out of school. And no substantial insights, revelations, or confessions. This book is not interesting, not revealing, and not informative. His sense of humor sucks.",A Masterpiece of Understatement & Drivel -- This Book is Lame
2951,"Helen Carey is an author that encompasses her readers from the very beginning. Her characters are well developed and the scenery described in such details that the readers begin to feel a part of the moment. Each book was eagerly anticipated and I was sorry to reach the end.
Highly recommended to anyone. Totally engrossing, I could not put them down.",Amazing series about the lives of everyday Londoners during WWII
2952,"I've read a lot of kindle books, and I mean A LOT. My whole kindle library is full of romance novels and this is hands down the best one I've read in awhile. This book literally had me so captivated till the end. I didn't want it to end. I actually cried when it ended I wasn't ready to part with these characters. Hilarious. Charming. Entertaining.

It's a bit dated when it comes to availability on dvd and videotape (no mention of Blu-Ray) as it was written about 10 years ago, but other than that, it's a very good information database about Japanese directors, actors, and significant movies. It's given me new titles to look for!","Well written Japanese cinema information, well worth the read for lovers of the craft"
2954,"You need to read Brutally Beautiful before you read this book. I highly recommend Brutally Beautiful. I loved it.

I loved the beginning of this book. Thought the middle was okay. I think it was too long. I was disappointed in Kade's behavior in the middle. It was completely out of character.

While a tried and true story arc, their relationship was genuine and worth reading about.",Hockey player and Juilliard Prodigy.. an unlikely combination!
2956,"He Who Walks In Shadow is an 'homage' novel in the best sense of the word.

Learn that our negative preconceived vision of an outcome of events can manifest them.

Mr. Mofina is an excellent writer and I always get involved with the characters and hooked into the story. His powers of description and detail are excellent. I particularly liked the one in a different book describing ""feather duster"" palm trees. I don't care for short stories, but I've event read most of those by Mofina. Please keep writing Mr. Mofina.

2960,"I downloaded this onto by Kindle (I never even thought about adding it to my Kindle phone app) on a recent trip to NYC, this was very handy to carry and refer to while touring the Big Apple.
The best thing that I can tell you is that we stayed in Times Square opposite the Half Price Ticket booth but with the help of the Lonely Planet Guide we located their other store in Lower Manhattan while we where down that way sightseeing at the Millennium Tower. We were able to buy West End show tickets without the bother of waiting in line. That made my day and made me appreciate the guide very much.",Great guide for your Kindle or App without carying around the bulky book
2961,"The characters in this book were so dysfunctional that it was delicious!  I should feel some amount of tangible guilt for enjoying their bad choices, humiliations and familial disasters, but I do not.  Basically, the book is sort of like reality tv, which happens to be a big theme floating through the plot, where the reader knows it going to implode, but we keep reading to see the much anticipated implosion.  Glad I took a chance on this book, it was worth the read.",The characters in this book were so dysfunctional that it was delicious!
2962,"This was a great action book, but wasn't what I was hoping for.  Was hoping for some more stuff with the molecule.  Still rated it 4 stars tho cuz I love the writing and the universe.

But it WAS really cool to get in depth character development on other characters that were left out in the other books.  That was awesome.",A deep look at other minor characters you may have been curious about.
2963,If Nora Roberts wrote Cowboy Romances they would be like this. Lindsey Brookes has a style all her own that brings you close to the characters. You know how it is going to end but you still want to get there through her eyes. Her passion for writing only brings out the best in this story. You can't help but fall in love with her characters.

2964,"This is a great book for kids, one page is text (not too much, font not too small, simple language), and the opposite page a drawing of the scene.  So, you've got both the text and a visual, and it keeps kids attention while reading it, in fact, they could read it on their own or to you!  Really a sort of later elementary school kind of book, like I said, great for kids!",One of the best Dickens Christmas Carol books for kids to read out loud or on their own!
2965,I recently discovered the Maisie Dobbs series and I am enjoying it very much.  I like the time period--between the world wars--and the characters.  Dobbs straddles class lines between her working-class past and middle-class present.  The idea of a woman who is a professional inquiry agent in the 1930s is also interesting.  The books are well written; the characters well developed; the plots logical but not too obvious.,I like the time period--between the world wars--and the characters
2966,"12th Century setting, based around the conflict between King Stephen and the Empress Maud. Excellent story telling, fascinating view of the life of a worldly Brother in an Abbey near the border. The engaging tale unfolds, book after book. However, at $7.99 each, I won't be able to continue in this manner.  Written in the 1980's, and each book short. Too expensive for me.","Interesting, well written tale of the Welsh English borderlands"
2967,Marjorie Sarnat did a great job with this book! Owls are SO CUTE & pages are full of hours of enjoyment! Each page is very unique and takes up the entire page... BONUS!

You won't be disappointed with this purchase!,Great addition to my coloring book collection! You won't be disappointed!
2968,"I read this in 2 sittings. It brought back so many memories of the days my son played little league, high school and college ball. It is a lovely story of determination, a mother's love, redemption and the intricacies of divorce, illness and pride. I would recommend this book. I did not give it 5 stars only because I wish it had been longer!","If you ever had a child who played baseball, you will appreciate this book!"
2969,"For some reason, this book has always charmed me ever since I discovered it and started reading it to my son 15+ years ago, which he really enjoyed.  It's lovely, fun and bittersweet all at the same time, like childhood and life itself.

My wife and I have carefully kept all our favorite childhood books of his, however, this one was lost in the moves we've made since then.  It was out of print for a while but once I saw it was back, snatched one up, and am glad I did.  Brought back great memories, and is now added to the collection for potential future grandchildren!

Highly recommended!","Charming, fun and bittersweet, like childhood and life itself"
2970,"I greatly enjoyed these stories. Classic good vs. evil, including that there is a cost and consequences for standing up to do the right thing. The story is plot-driven, and so the general turn is predictable, but there are plenty of surprises here, too. I dropped the rating to 4 stars for a need of greater character depth.",Great reads. Takes on the age-old issue of what good people must do in the face of evil

2972,"I thought that based on the recommendation by Stephen King that it was the first great thriller of 2017 that it would be a bit dark, a true thriller, maybe even horror. Its none of those things.  Instead its one of those cutesy, highly ironic romance novels masquerading (rebranded) as a thriller like so many others these days. Its certainly not thrilling, theres really not any tension or any creatively plotted mystery. It plays out like a Lifetime TV movie at best. The only reason for two stars over one is because at least it features a bit of professional polish.","Its a romance novel, not a thriller or horror novel. Dont be fooled."
2973,"This book can appear dense and convoluted in the writing style, but if you are willing to sift through his analogies and read it, there is a lot of good information.

Overall I liked it for the most part.",pretty good read with just a few things could have been better.
2976,"The Dog Catcher by Lloyd Johnson was a page turner.  It was hard for me to put this book down.  I love that the story gives background from her early childhood, her parent's relationship, her issues with self and relationship; it address homosexuality, abusive relationships, mental instabilities, and a host of other issues.  Cheryl's issues can and are those of many ladies today.  I love the twists, the turns, the letdowns and the wins.  I have recommended this book to my family, friends and book clubs.  Great job!

2980,"This is a well written account of an articulate young woman from a middle class background who made some foolish choices earlier in her life and was eventually convicted and spent time in various prisons.  The story is very interesting, and the differences between different prisons is shocking.  I cared about the author and many of the women she wrote about in her story.

I guarantee that you have either encountered them in others around you, but this work is about getting you to take a long look in the mirror at those things that may be getting in your way.  Carter is masterful at helping you look at the behaviors that keep you from being all that you can be.

2982,I should have read the reviews first.  This started out with a really good plot but never followed through.  Very dissatisfying ending.  I didn't feel anything  in the second half of the book was explained. The ending was a sex scene with nothing resolved.  The second half of the book definitely felt rushed.,This started out with a really good plot but never followed through
2983,"I'm returning to read some of the EU novels I started when I was younger but never finished. Decoding to go chronologically may seem silly, but it is going to at least bring me to different places I may not have expected to visit. This book, for example. I'm glad I read it, as reviews had scared me away. There is nothing special about this book, other than being a story in the Star Wars universe. But then again, that universe is, unto itself, something special. It was a treat to immediately jump back into the adventure and pick up where the saga left off.","While a fun read, it lacks anything special to keep it long in your memory."
2984,"This great historical accounting is truly unique in a couple aspects. And it ties in with another excellent written history: Ben Comee A Tale of Rogers's Rangers, 1758-59. The two are essential and inextricably linked. just like the 1st & 2nd Amendments are linked.

2986,"This is, without a doubt, one of the most suspenseful books I have ever read. A serial killer is targeting beautiful, highly motivated young women. They are held for several days before they are killed.
The author gives insight into the killer's mind by interspersing chapters using his point of view. These chapters follow him as he progresses from childhood cruelties to his adult perversions.

2987,"Finding a book thats so rare and unlike anything else Ive ever read is pretty hard to come by these days. I have no idea how Jewel managed to craft such an original story, but Transcend is truly unique and I had such a hard time putting it down. The writing is so fluid and it reads so quickly. I really connected with the characters and genuinely care about what happens to them. I recommend going in blind on this one for the best reading experience. I am so looking forward to Epoch and finding out how this story ends.",... rare and unlike anything else Ive ever read is pretty hard to come by these days

I know the cover looks silly and the title is silly too, but it's going to make you think and give you some of the best advice -as a man- -from other men, and great men at that- which will help you improve your life and yourself in ways you didn't think possible.

I liked the connections between the different people telling the story, how the author got you to care about the people through what they lived through, how they handled it.  Definitely would not want to live in this kind of world, though.",one minute things are normal and the next it's all gone sideways in the worst possible way
2990,"This was my first book by Hazel James but it will certainly not be my last!

2991,"Biomass Revolution isNicholas Sansbury Smith first book. I have read just about every series he his written and I finally got to this one. For a first novel I really enjoyed the story because it was so unique.
However it was a little difficult at first to keep track of all the characters and took me a little while to decipher who the actual story was about.
Overall I think is one of the books that are considered  a  diamond in the rough and can become a cult classic. Kinda reminds of the movie  equilibrium.",For a first novel I really enjoyed the story because it was so unique

2995,"I work in the healthcare field, and am always interested in finding out the patients' perspectives on their diseases/conditions. Parkinson's is something I see in quite a few of my regular patients, so this book was a must-read for me.

The author deals with Parkinson's in a rather humorous way, while shedding light on what it's like for patients living with the disease. A graphic novel made it a breeze to read, and probably makes it more appealing to a wider audience. The fact that Dunlap-Stohl is telling this story from first-hand experience makes it an enlightening and personal read.",while shedding light on what it's like for patients living with the disease

2999,"Like most other reviews stated, this book examines the use of modern Social Networking tools (like Facebook, custom websites for grassroots purposes, text messaging, etc.) in President Obama's successful 2008 campaign.  The book then applies those uses to modern day business, trying to convince the reader how a business could succeed if it were to follow the Obama campaign's model.

Overall, I felt it was an ok and quick read.  I felt, however, that it already states the obvious for any business person who wishes to implement the use of social networking in their business.",Successful use of Social Networking and how it can be used in business

Many of the historic buildings are still surprisingly standing in the City including the venue in which Lincoln delivered a speech which helped him to gain the presidency.

3003,When I started reading this series it took me a bit to get use to the writing style of the author so I almost didn't read it.

I don't like any of the bronte sisters works. I've always admired George Eliot and Gaskell over them. They don't write high octane pathetic romances, but the social and poltical dynamics involved in their work has always been far more interesting.

It's is at the top of my list of the worst books I've wasted money on. What's wrong with it: the writing is horrific, the plot ridiculous, the characters psychotic (even the ""sane"" ones).

Dozens of pages spent rehashing past events and worn-out quirks like Lewrie's iced tea, and bland slice of life stuff which isn't particularly good historical fiction.  Matching the language and mundane details was never Lambdin's strength and it isn't now.  Little of the humor or snarl of the early ones.  Just the notion that Lewrie is a rascal I guess is supposed to be enough, while what we get to read about is him worrying about the cost of household items.",Dozens of pages spent rehashing past events and worn-out quirks like Lewrie's iced tea

Why Private Vergas? What does Vegas have to do with anything except some casual mentions here and there? If anything, California seemed to get more coverage than Vegas.

3020,"This book is filled with stories of big wave surfers.  What I loved most about this book is that the stories are told from the perspective of the surfers themselves.  Yes, there is a fair amount of surf jargon, but isn't that what we want to hear so we can learn more about the world of surfers?  Perhaps not everyone understands what a big wave gun or a cutback or a regular foot is, but isn't that why we read?

Took me a little while to get into the characters, but they really started to come to life about 1/4 of the way through the book.  Their story also came together at that point, and the book went from a casual read to a can't-wait-to-read-more experience.

I do not know what I would have followed it as well, or gotten much out of it, if I had not already read the original book, however.  It does not not go into depth in the same way the the book does, but it is a very good overview.",Good reiteration and reinforcement for those working to master the 7 habits!
3028,Flavel's book is an excellent meditation on the important doctrine of the providence of God.  He convincingly demonstrates that God sovereignly cares for his flock in all areas of life and encourages the Lord's people to bear dutifully up under both comfortable and uncomfortable providences of God.  God is always working for our good and Flavel's work is a helpful reminder to this fact.  All Christians would do well to read this small book.,Flavel clears away enough of the mystery to encourage us greatly

If this book had been written using Microsoft word, half the entire book would be green squiggly underlined.

Apparently it's black & white and about 99% text with a few illustrations. If you are an in-dept gardener and want to grow vegetables to the point of being pretty much self-sustainable, then this might be the book for you, but if you're just looking for a intro guide on easy vegetable growing that maybe just says when to plant, how much to water, and how much sunlight, then look for elsewhere.","This book is for those SERIOUS about growing vegetables, not just for those wanting to dabble in it."
3039,I had a great time reading this trilogy.  The author could leave it here and my imagination will take the characters deeper into their own fantasies.

Zack and Kylie are NYPD Red detectives, serving only rich and famous, but they are also ex lovers, having been together briefly while back at the police academy. Their personal relationship gets a little too close in this book, with Zach having a girlfriend, and Kylie's husband in rehab.

The life of this man and the development of cults after his death and death are preented based on available evidence and with educated arguments for likely motivations of all involved.

3048,"This is a fabulous and honest biography that it makes reading it a joy.  It is very well written and an easy read, but more importantly it is one of the few direct and straightforward books that observes fairly and candidly the Israeli/Palestinian problem and shares that this is a two sided problem that must have a two sided solution.

I enjoyed this book tremendously.  I also took a great deal of solace from the fact that it covered so many events that are touched upon in my novel ""The Peacemaker Struggle.""  The General's Son"" conveys a refreshing presentation and perspective on this issue.",A refreshing presentation and perspective on this misunderstood issue.
3049,"I enjoyed direct quotes from Jefferson's letters at the beginning of each chapter.  This story, based in historical fact, is dramatic and riveting.
I only gave 4 stars due to the authors' ungrammatical use of ""I"" instead of ""me"" as the object of a preposition on at least 2 occasions. (Such as- to Joe and I instead of Joe and me.) I can't believe both authors and editors overlooked such blaring grammatical errors.  It makes me question the scholarship and definitely distracts greatly from an otherwise well-written work of fiction.",Well written  and well-imagined historical fiction (but for grammar mistakes)

3051,"This was a sweet story about Dylan and her sister Dusty's wedding.  The problem is that Dusty is a reality TV star and Dylan is a shy 16 year old shadow in her sisters glamour.

I like how the story begins with the sisters being at odds with each other and how Dylan starts to see that Dusty isn't the shallow ""Barbie"" that she presents on the surface.

3053,"For years I have been looking for a book that helps me to understand the Jewish roots and culture as it pertains to the bible. Though this book is not a bible commentary, it references specific verses each meditation and delves into the meaning of the Hebrew words. This has become my new favorite meditation book. To understand God's Word from the People who wrote it is an invaluable resource. I have begun giving it as gifts and highly recommending it to well versed friends who are going deeper into their faith as a result of the book. I wish I could give it six stars.",Six Stars!!!

He drones on and on about his inner struggle in going on the Hajj while being a (somewhat unbelieving) anthropologist and I found it to be redundant. I learned some interesting things about the pilgrimage through this book, but I think a lot of the theory was lost on me because I don't have much of a background in it--I would have much rather enjoyed a book which was less him and more experience.

I found other sources to learn the basics at a slower pace and then came back to this book.  It has taught me to make outstanding and beautiful tassels that are fantastic to give as gifts.

Also, it was confusing trying to remember or figure out who the narrator was because the author didn't identify who was speaking.  Sometimes I couldn't tell if the narrator was male or female except by language clues. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but this would be hard to do since there is very little to spoil.

When I saw that Scotty Cade had written a book about two attendees falling in love, I knew I had to read it.  It definitely made me wonder where he was going with the story and how it would end.

Protein alternatives are hard to come up with and they give some options. The meal plans also help with that problem, in learning how to replace meat as protein sources.

3307,"Well written but I just wanted it to end. The suspense was one of trauma and tragedy and it's hard to put yourself in that for a period of time. Usually you start out with the normal day-to-day and then tragedy strikes. I do like how she layed it out, and the writing was excellent, but I just couldn't wait for it to be over. I've never wanted to erase a book from my kindle until now! Wow-that is saying a lot-I didn't even want to SEE it again. I'm sure each reader will react differently based on their own headspace at the time!","Well written, suspenseful, well layed out...BUT I wanted to erase it from my Kindle!"
3308,"If you are new fan of Shark Tank, you will enjoy this book as it shares several success stories from over the years. If you watched the show from the beginning you will probably remember most of the advice or find it redundant.

3309,"The Wild West Series keeps getting better and better. There's suspense and nail-biting danger, and the main characters Judd and Cecily have smoking hot chemistry. Plus, there are more than a few surprises/skeletons in their respective closets, adding spice and a dollop of ""uh-oh"" when things go sideways. Top it off with some ""I didn't see that coming"" plot twists and you have a recipe for another fine read from this author.

I voluntarily reviewed the ARC of this book.",Romantic suspense and smoking hot chemistry makes this a winner
3310,"These books show, in rich detail, what life in a small village was like just before World War 2. I laughed a lot and very occasionally cried, but was entertained by every chapter & all the eccentric animal owners of all the books!

3312,"The first 160 pages were the backstory before you get to their life with their famous friends. I don't mind that so much if it's all relevant, but parts just dragged on. Also, I don't think the fictional character Owen was necessary. Their lives had so much going on, and she's obviously a talented writer, she didn't need to make him up to allege that Gerald was a homosexual. Her book gave me a great interest in finding out more about this family-I was just dismayed that reading this book didn't do the trick!

It is the definitive work on this topic. Despite its age (the English translation was published in 1961), it remains in a class by itself.

2)Absolutely stunning and charming novella about two women who couldn't be more dissimilar who meet, discover an attraction, and proceed to make every possible awkward faux pas known to womanhooduntil they figure out how not to.

It's why I love dystopian literature. Lisa Hall's ""Girl Found"" is both dystopian and paranormal in tone. I liked the main character's sense of humor. Some of her private thoughts made me laugh out loud. I really enjoy that in a book. If a novel can make me laugh a couple times, it was definitely worth my money.

Also, recipes that were listed as ""quick"" involved having pre-cooked the ingredients like quinoa or potatoes and the time listed was just throwing the pre-cooked stuff together and heating it for 10 minutes.

3564,"I'm finding this an excellent overview of the three religions, if perhaps somewhat idealistic and simplistic.  I'm a Christian (Episcopal) so the descriptions of our faith fit the kind of Christianity I'm familiar with, but I recognize that more conservative branches of our faith would not agree with many points.  That makes me wonder how slanted the descriptions of Judaism and Islam similarly may be.

This lends a real level of realism which most space operas lack. As fun as it is to watch your protagonist excel at everything they try, it is a bit unrealistic. Here, Brazee is able to greatly humanize his characters.

3629,"Beautifully written, but with a sort of preciousness that made me glad to see the3 end of the book.  I really am impressed by Atwood's abilities, but  in the end, perhaps just a bit overly stylized.  I really do assume it is all a matter of taste, as she really is a major writer...just not for me...but she just might really ring your chimes.  I am tempted to rate it higher just for Atwood's beautiful prose.","Beautifully written, but failed to hold my interest...maybe my fault."
3630,"Well, I got this book from the library after reading all the great reviews and am grateful I'm not out any money.  I made it 3/4 through and said enough.  To be fair, she is very learned, as she is educated and a decent writer. This book's title is very misleading.  It reads like a campus lecture sometimes and at other times, it reads like she's critiquing all the other authors she collected at the library table she ever thought could have been a misanthrope and wrapped it in a cool title to get us to read it.",I got this book from the library after reading all the great reviews and am grateful I'm not out any money

Must reading for the serious art photographer.,A must have for the fine art photographer or collector of such works.
3632,"This book has everything a cruising sailor needs to know for doing his own canvas work, and then some. There is a good balance in the treatment of traditional and modern techniques and materials, although high-tech stuff is almost completely omitted. The illustrations are amazing and gorgeous, and the text is a pleasure to read. Along with Bowditch and ""Ar Vag"" (by Bernard Cadoret et al), this is one of the most prized treasures of my shipboard library. I only wish it were available in hardcover.","Excellent and very complete DIY guide, with beautiful illustrations"
3633,"I have generally loved how Silva has interwoven the political with the personal, and international intrigue with the art world, history and culture of the places he takes his readers.  While the English Spy was enjoyable, there was a level of predictability about it I did not expect, and a level of political insight at a lower level that I had expected.  Still a great read.",I have generally loved how Silva has interwoven the political with the personal
3634,"This series does not appear to be one of Larson's better efforts...Wooden dialog. 2 Dimensional characters. However, plot does move along at a reasonable pace. First book I'd give 3 stars, maybe... Lead character is becoming less and less sympathetic and lead female character is reduced to a bimbo. The more I think about the characters, the less I like any of them.",... series does not appear to be one of Larson's better efforts.
3635,I would describe this book as a historical fiction that takes place during World War II.  During the war many pilots would crash in foreign countries and would need help escaping back to their own country or an allied country.  This book tells the story of a female who takes on the responsibility of getting these people home.  The book also talks about her sister who stays home during the war and her city gets occupied by the Germans.

I would recommend this book to a reader who likes adventure of surfers and the chance to look at a world that large number of society never gets to participate in or even knows about competition events.  It has romance, rivalry, friendship, and family.  I recommend reading the book.",When you look in the rearview mirror the person who caused you trouble is looking back at you!
3638,"You could tell at times that it was originally written in German as it was slightly less flowy than it could be. Some interactions felt and fell short because of that....and everything came together just a little too easy.

They are both equally good, and will leave you with a wonderfully warm heart.  I found both of the novels to be very moving, with engaging characters that I just fell in love with.

3641,"Catherine M. Wilson has managed to write three books that are connected by love, treachery, caring, war and everyday life in a far past time. When Women Were Warriors is a tale of old ways and present day feelings of love and honor. Strong characters lead the way, evil characters plot and scheme. These are people you care about. When you start reading, get comfy. You will be reading for a while.","Wonderful trilogy about ancient lives, that are just like ours."
3642,"This is a book I will buy several more times to give to friends and relatives as a gift.  It has the feel of an instant classic, which will be read far into the future.  Pax is about a boy and his fox, but it's also an adventure story, and a story about the real costs of war.  The chapters alternate between our main protagonist, and Pax, his ""pet"" fox that he is forced to release into the wild. Wracked with guilt, Peter goes on a 300 mile journey to find Pax and bring him home.  Highly recommend.","A book you will buy several times, just to give to others as a gift."
3643,I am having a very hard time finishing this book. Alice has changed from a determined and self controlled survivor to a loser willing to crawl into a bottle to cope. There is no way the character in the first book would react like the loser in the second. Authors should not write characters experiencing PTSD if they don't understand human nature. So disappointing.,There is no way the character in the first book would react like the loser in the second
3644,Badass Girl's is a tremendously helpful book! It is full of ideas and observations that are valuable to women so that we may avoid becoming victims of violent crime. CJ's opening up about her experiences and the guilt and shame she had to overcome make this book even more valid adding a human touch and putting a face on sexual crime against women. I highly recommend this book. I think it should become required reading in college courses and perhaps even high school as it may help ladies to avoid becoming trapped in compromising situations.,A Tremendously Powerful Book Promoting Pro-Active Steps to Survival

But here's the good part: every one of those people - every single one - has contacted me AFTER finishing the book to say THANK YOU much more emphatically.  The style of writing, combined with the layout, seduce you into beginning to read. You won't fully realize you've begun reading the book until several minutes later. Buy it. You won't regert it.

3650,"This was a difficult book to read. It's hard enough to imagine an adult being locked up in an area approx. 8x8' but it is heartbreaking to read it happening to a child. The saddest part is that a local policeman told his superiors that he felt he had found the kidnapper...and they took absolutely no action!

I liked how it described the way Myrrh is harvested. My 9 year old said that now he knows where Myrrh comes from when we finished. So I'd say that the book served as a science lesson along with part of the Christmas season. What a good find.,A different perspective to learn about Christmas gifts for baby Jesus

I found myself picturing myself in the streets of Blade Runner and Total Recall. I did not think the characters could possible get more complex, but Rhett pulled it off!

This story takes you on a journey through the struggle for freedom and the costs of freedom.  This book stands on it's own, but if you love it - run don't walk to pick up the Titanborn series.",A great read on the struggle and costs for true freedom - a must read!
3758,"The product came in great conditions. I just started to read the book, good so far.. I'm planning on taking the exam by the end of the month, I already went through the CBT nuggets and I have been practicing & studying on my own...

Really really works, I get compliments on the way the colors are put together...main color is normally my pants, then my top topping it off with my scarf.  I am a big scarf person.  My shoes normally same color as my pant...not always..depending.  One can not go wrong with is most amazing book.

3760,I really liked this book.  I have the original and decided to purchase the revised one and this one. Both are worth the price. These women can cook!!  The flavor and efficient recipes makes them all winners.  We haven't had one yet that we haven't liked.  And with six people in our family that is saying a lot !!,Excellent Book Worth the Price-the Flavor of the Food Is Wonderful !
3761,"I have enjoyed the Swift River Valley novel series.  I grew up in a small town not too far from the setting of this book, and it feels comfortable and familiar to read about the characters.  However, there isn't a lot that happens in the book.  I'm not a fan of danger, or stalking/suspense, but I do enjoy the mysteries, especially the historical connections, from the earlier novels in the series.  I will still watch for books in the series, but I would like to see a little more actually happening in later stories.","a beautiful setting and interesting characters, but not much action"
3762,"Facinating portrait of bipolarity from the inside and the outside. Dr. Jamison (Ph. D) tells her own story of struggles with bipolar disorder, in her case on the rather extreme manic side, as well as explaining what she has uncovered in her research on the subject (a little.) For those on the depressive side, or people who care about them, this is interesting but not as helpful, and can be frightening. For those on the manic side, or those who care about them, a deep breath is required several times through the book.",An insightful autobiography about being bipolar (on the manic side)
3763,"The best thing about this book was it's short. This was so silly and predictable I kept thinking I picked up my 8 year old granddaughters book by mistake. Even the lusty stuff seemed juvenile and silly. Lizzy and Diesel reminded me of Joe and Stephine. They were the same characters with the same dynamics. And what was up with the monkey? The cat didn't really add to the story either, I guess another hampster would be all to familiar.",WITH SOME EDITING THIS WOULD BE PERFECT FOR LITTLE KIDS. THEY WOULD LOVE THE MONKEY.
3764,"I absolutely LOVED this book.  It really is the best collection of short stories I've ever read, which is a huge compliment.  All the stories in this book are in some way related to Vietnam.  Many of the stories take place there, and the ones that take place in the US are for the most part first or second generation Vietnamese Americans.  The stories in this book stem from actual Vietnamese folk tales, which I am not familiar with.  Now, though, I think it would be really interesting to learn about Vietnamese folk lore.",Unique and enthralling book that makes you stay up all night reading it
3765,"My son was 16 when he entered a drug treatment facility. I firmly believe it saved his life. But, since we'd given him every opportunity in life - great neighborhood, great schools - it was hard to understand his need to drug himself to oblivion. Chad Hepler's book takes you into the mind of a teen drug addict and helps you understand the process of recovery.

Intervention is a compelling story that will drag you from the front cover all the way to the back cover. If you're a parent struggling to understand and empathize with your child, read this book today!",As Parents Struggle to Understand their Children This will Help
3766,"I thoroughly enjoy the entire ""Alice in Deadland"" series.  They are an entertaining read.  You can bond with the characters and feel their emotions.  These are fun, well written books and for anyone who says otherwise...  come on, you can't compare these to some literary classic - these are fun fiction action packed story telling at it's best!",AWESOME!!!  Entertaining read - I hope the author writes more!
3767,"Amazing salad recipes and delicious too! The author does full justice to the title. I had never explored the idea of salad in a jar, but the way the author explains it makes me want to experiment. Loads of interesting recipes in the book - i am planning to start with Mediterranean Chickpea Salad today. Love the book!",Amazing salad recipes and delicious too! The author does full justice to the title.
3768,"I just received this.  The book looks very helpful.  The cards exude energy and the artwork is captivating.  The card stock is cheap, thin.  It is a disservice to Ciro Marchetti to present his work in cheap packaging on cheap card stock.  If I were Mr. Marchetti, I would stick to using U.S.Games as my publisher.  The presentation of ""Gilded Reverie"" with its heavy box, magnetic lid, thick gilded and lacquered card stock; speaks to the quality and high standard his work deserves.  I also like using cards that will last awhile with a sturdy box in which to store them.","Cheap, thin card stock, cheap packaging but excellent artwork and interpretation book."
3769,"I've recently become a bit of a WWII fan. Seeing the war thru the eyes of a young American  from the North East, and his pen-pal in Holland, made this historical novel very readable. You are drawn to see what happens without feeling like you are reading about history. Excellent read!  Bob from California","Revisit WWII and experience the fear, bravery, terror, and yes, a bit of romance."
3770,"This author likes her military men but doesn't really like to do her research. The details of the actions of the EOD personnel that lead to the death in this book are not accurate. EOD techniques are highly specialized, the schooling is long and difficult and to include it in any way should honor these brave men and woman with accurate and real research. It may seem like a badass job to throw a character into (and it is! I know) but the details are important. Do your research or pick a different type of hero.",This author likes her military men but doesn't really like to do her research
3771,"Although you might think it childish to use mnemonics to learn a language, it is a powerful tool used effectively in this book to speeds up the learning process tremendously. I liked that the book has 2 sided printable flashcards that come on the included CD. Over all this book is well layer out with very good explanations of Kana rules (like Tenten, Maru and Glides), as well as examples of commonly mistaken Kana. The exercises are short enough (yet relevant) to not make you want to just skip them. Easily one of the best books to quickly learn Hiragana and katakana.",Wonderful book that can speed up your understanding of Hiragana and Katakana.
3772,"When a book drives me to look up more information, in this case about Iceland and the author, I know it is good. 'Burial Rites' is a  relatively slow paced but well-written read that somehow keeps you on the edge. You enter another age, another period of time and another very different type of country. Thinking back on my journey through the book, it was like bathing in mollasses while a killer stood by and tentatively smiled.","Worth the read - it's interesting, melodic and out of your time and experience"
3773,"a fresh take on a classic SF story, The Ballad of Black Tom takes us on a remarkable journey through time and space. Tackling a distinctly Lovecraft story, but this time without the racism, it's a joy to read and experience. Highly recommended for SF fans, historical fiction fans or simply those who enjoy great writing.","What's old is new again, and oh so much better than the original"
3774,"Meh. I am sure it's good for most dog owners getting into positive training, but I was hoping for some ""magic"" (edit: new and effective) tips from the late Dr. Yin. Was a bit surprised that she never talked about eye contact,  the importance of teaching it to your dog, and getting contact before asking the dog to do something. It's not necessary to teach it with a food lure to the face--that's counterproductive.  I loved Sophia Yin but I thought this book would be better.",I am sure it's good for most dog owners getting into positive training
3775,"This book is outstanding, I devoured it in a day. And not like a chill Saturday afternoon, this bookended a 20-hour day, but I was not giving in to sleep until I'd read it all.

Like the whole Wayfarers series (they each stand alone, grab em in any order) it's a future I'm achingly desperate to live in. I give it my highest rating: grown-ass man weeping openly into his Kindle.

Since I finished it I've been furtively glancing at my teetering stack of library books, trying to decide if I should read it again.","An outstanding addition to an outstanding series, a million stars out of five."
3776,"I didn't check the size of the book, or the quality.  The contents are exactly what I expected but I would have liked a more managable size (not 8 1/2 x 11), better paper and a better cover.

3784,"Some of the book tends to be dry and technical, but overall I found it very informative. I especially liked the segments where the author highlighted real-life crime cases and how forensics worked to reveal the perpetrators. This book was advertised for mystery or crime authors, but it is also useful for readers, such as myself. Then I can decide whether the book or author is worth reading, or if they are full of B.S. :-) and totally unbelievable.",Good reference book for readers too! We can decide if mystery-crime authors and their books are worth reading or not
3785,"This book keeps you reading just to discover what is really going on.  Are these murders connected to the optical profession? Is it the husband?  Lots of red herrings and twists.  I figured out who the killer was about half way through the book.  But, I did not come close to figuring out the graphic ending.  Please, if you enjoy thrillers, don't read ahead.  Find out and feel as shocked at the end as I was.",Do not read ahead... Enjoy the book as it was written.  The ending is worth it!

3788,"Nobody captures the dark suppurating underbelly of Hollywood like Bruce Wagner. This is probably my favorite of his books - rarely has such ugliness been presented in such a beautiful, wryly funny style, with rich, imaginative metaphors.

3792,"I guess the best way to describe ""Full Dark, No Stars"" is by saying it shows us the deepest, darkest secrets of everyday, ordinary people. In 1922, Big Driver, A Good Marriage and A Fair Extension, none of the characters are supernatural, spooky, fantastical creatures. Quite on the contrary, they are your friends, your neighbours, your family. And oh, the secretes they hide!!!

I find it amusing that someone who demands academic perfection from her daughters, doesn't demand it of herself.

These books make for great chuckles, sweet moments, and adventure.  April Grace says often that she's trying to be a better person.

While geared for young adults, it is for anyone who has ever written, wanted to write or thought about writing.  It breaks writing down into steps that build on one another like a recipe.

It is an excellent example of a work in progress, and the editor in you wants to make suggestions etc. Which makes it ever so much more than just a read.

HIs reporting is rock-solid, thought some of the scenes he presents seem almost too insane to be true.

Isla is humiliated by her ex boyfriend after an uncomfortable experience with his sexual wants, plus she has a job where she is not appreciated and at time belittled, her life has led her to find comfort in food.  She finally does something about it and it changes a lot of things about her life and as she starts feeling better about herself it leads into an uncertain romance with Wes.  I voluntarily agreed to read and review an advanced copy of this book.","Betrayal, Intrigue, and self discovery, a thought provoking book."

3825,"First and First (Five Boroughs Series)  totally captivated me. The characters are complex and *real* - you care about them, deeply. The plot is a skillfully fashioned erotic romance, but with real meat on those bones. The writing is stellar, the editing fantastic.
If you haven't discovered this author, I'm here to tell you don't wait. And although it's a series, First and First can be read as a standalone, though each book is so good, you really should begin with Sutphin Boulevard, then go to Sunset Park - all highly recommended reads. 5* unequivocally.","This might just be my favorite of the series, highly recommended"
3826,"Although this was written in the mid twentieth century, and current readers would certainly pick up on the dated elements, there is enough commonality for YA and middle readers of the 21st century to follow without issue. The mystery and suspense can definitely drive even the most reluctant reader to stick with this novel through the end. Surprisingly well developed characters for such a short novel. Definitely a recommended read for middle schoolers.","Well written, suspenseful, and excellent character development"
3827,"Interesting book with case studies of how some have made money by ""doing good.""  Can't say that I learned any new business principles from the content, but it was interesting to see how some entrepreneurs have seen a need (technical and social) and have found a way to make a buck from it.  It's not much different from a typical entrepreneur who sees any kind of need and goes after it; this book just focuses on the ""social needs.""","Interesting book of case studies, but don't expect to learn new business principles"
3828,"I loved everything about this book. It had it all. There where moment's that I was shocked, laughing, and tensed to see what will happen. Melody and Liam chemistry was so good. They complemented each other. I also, loved the dark side of things and that Melody character was a strong female with power and talent to do things her way. Melody did not let herself be pushed around by dominating man.",I highly recommend this book if like things dark with a touch of romances.
3829,"This is a thin book and on 68 pages. It would be best called a comic book version of Call of the Wild. My children really like Raina Telgemeier's graphic novels and I was hoping to get them some classic books similar to hers but this is thin, and the font does not fit in well with the drawing. Not to belittle what I am sure was a sincere effort, but it comes off as amateurish. It was okay but I would have not bought it had I seen it in person first. I would rank higher if it was clearly started that it is a much more like a comic book than a graphic novel.",Very short - not a novel - does not capture fullness of the book

3831,"Paddle Your Own Canoe is essentially Nick Offerman's autobiography. In retrospect, I'm not really sure what I was expecting from this book. For the most part, it reads like an old-timey tale from a man discussing his upbringing in rural illinois, move to Chicago and eventual breakthrough into acting, interspersed with folksy advice, and long (and rather off-topic) rants about things like slavery.

All in all, I kept imagining Nick Offerman's trademark deadpan voice while reading. Thus I would recommend just getting the audiobook to hear him tell his story in his own words.",May as well purchase the audiobook version to hear it in Offerman's voice
3832,"I like the way the book unfolds, with events from the various campaigns running parallel. The authors are fair but also willing to toss out an occasional zinger. As a Democrat, I feel that I know a lot about Obama and his re-election team, but very little about Mitt Romney. The authors bring him to life in a way TV coverage did not. Political junkies will love this book, but even average voters will learn a lot. If you are a person who loathes Romney as much as Obama, buy another book, Too much even-handedness for extremists here.","Scholarly, impartial, well-researched-might double down or up on your preconceptions"

Its a patient and demanding read (and this is my second go at it  and not quite done).  The scene is thoroughly embedded in the Ireland of its day.  The characters are a rich roster whose fame continues: Leopold Bloom, Stephen Daedalus, the deceased Patty Dignam, et al. Consider reading Portrait of the Artist before Ulysses as a preview to Joyces style.
Yet this version was free on the Kindle e-reader.",... more can be said about a novel considered the best novel of the 20th C
3834,She is one of the best writers out there.  She does not wast one word; sometimes one has to reread what she wrote because she manages to say so much in so few words.  Perhaps that is why she never wrote a full novel but only short stories.  She got the Nobel prize and is well worth it.  Longwinded writers could learn from her - but it is a gift to write as she does.  Her stories are great - show so much insight.,Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You: 13 Stories (Vintage) Alice Munro
3835,"I really enjoyed this book. The main character starts in America, moves to England and then to Europe. The plot keeps you guessing and cheering on the heroine. Four stars because it starts out slow and the ending you will have to decide if you like it or not. An interesting look at the freedom of women in America, to the laid back with some social rules England, and then to the restrictive woman's social, moral conformity in Europe.",Interesting look at woman's free sprit vs social conformities

It gets very wordy and repetetive, and I thought she didn't like it because she kept wanting to skip over the pages that had over 5 lines of print, but she does really love it so much that if I put it down and pick up another book, she howls and throws a temper tantrum.",18 month old daughter loves it...screeeeams if I read a different book!

It has been a great book to read in the car or in the morning. This was probably my favorite book because I could learn about recent events dating from the early 1800s to the end of the USSR in 1991. There was also information on the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. This is a great volume and it is the perfect tool to learn about this world's history. -A review by a 11 year old.","A great, first-class history book. It is unfortunate it is the last."
3842,"great mystery with a compelling main character... hard-bitten Swedish serial killer detective, Harry Hole.  The books are fascinating because of the deep characterizations, the cynical comment on Swedish life--the hedonism, the pagan nature of the people, and how almost everything is borrowed from America.  Harry is a stone-cold alcoholic, but he fights the urges.  He has more integrity than the rest of the sorry bunch, even though he's a slovenly outsider and barely keeps it together mentally.  Great great book(s).",Harry Hole fights crime by deduction and living in the gutter with his suspects
3843,"This is a great introduction to a very promising series.  The plot is tight and, while the characters are somewhat formulaic, they are not cardboard.  What really makes this series interesting is the character of William Sparhawk, a young officer with a very high moral code.  Since this is the introductory volume, there is much to explore and develop; but that's what makes reading so enjoyable.  We can see how this universe develops how each individual becomes more 'real'.

Mr. Larson - when does the next book come out?",No rogues this time - clear an unabashed moral codes.  Bravo!
3844,"First this is a decidedly conservative book. If you want a liberal slant on things watch any Hollywood movie or any number of TV shows. I thought that this was a great second novel in, what I hope will be a series of novels. It was altogether almost too prescient for me. (Just recently DC has decided that there will be three sexes listed on their drivers license.)It is fast paced.  He fully develops the characters
 as the book  proceeds. To me the most scary thing is that the scenario in the book could possibly happen.","A summer jewel of a beach book, that should be read the other three seasons also."
3845,"I love the continued development of the main characters: Walt, Vic and Henry Standing Bear, but I could have done without the car chase scenes and the prolonged suspense.  It seemed as if the book was written more as a screen play for TV or Movie rather than as a focused novel of the ""thriller genre"".  I'm still thrilled with the Wyoming setting, the knowledge of Native American tradition, and Craig Johnson's wonderful sense of humor.","Same great sense of humor, but the suspense was a little forced."

Her observations are quite interesting about his schedule, the way he wrote (she pasted in the long emendations to his work) and other interesting details.

3859,At first I was not sure about this book. It seemed a bit high priced to me for a planner. But then my daughter was expressing her frustration at not feeling like she is accomplishing much each day and not staying focused. I had just ordered this book on a whim when it was on sale and I had set it aside on a shelf until I could decide whether I would use it or give it to a child.

She seemed reserved but positive so hopefully this will be an answered prayer.,Great for a child who needs to see their plans as well as their progress each day.

3861,"It's tough to rate this book, given the quality of PB's other novels.  Windup Girl, Shipbreaker and Drowned Cities are terrific.  Maybe my expectations for this book were too high, but I found the plot to be very thin, with largely predictable characters.  Also, as someone who works closely with western water rights, it was difficult to accept the premise of an unknown water right, and how that might be used.

I wanted to like this book, but at the end of it all, it was easy to close and move on.  I would be much more likely to reread Windup Girl.","Occasionally interesting, but a long way from The Windup Girl"
3862,"This story was ridiculously sappy and juvenile.  It was more sophomoric silliness than adult content.  The story itself wasn't at all original, and neither were the characters.

The heroine is sweet and the hero is rich, powerful, handsome and devoted to his young daughter (though his perfection is tempered by his short fuse).

3866,"Armentrout's voice shines when there is tension between her love interest characters. In this case, Dawson and Bethany's romantic arc is love at first sight, which means all of their conflict is external and the sparks aren't quite there. Even though this is the first in the series, albeit published after Obsidian, I would start with Obsidian.

I would still recommend buying Shadows because it adds to the world building. But I felt as though the characters, while well written initially, became just a foil for Katie and Daemon's story.","Sweet romance, a la Romeo & Juliet, but not quite as sparkling as Obsidian"

Being able to relate to a character is important to me, therefore her descriptions must be good. And they really are. She writes about real people, with good qualities and bad.

3887,"I was listening to this at the gym, snorting with laughter, and my husband kept giving me funny looks and asking what was going on. Then I'd have to tell him about s***ting on airplane seats or biologically accurate boy dolls. Which is awkward to do at the gym. Shame on you, Karen, for making this so funny!

I don't have kids quite yet, but listening to this audiobook and not running for the hills makes me think it's about time. So...thanks?

3888,"""I received a free copy of this title from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.""

This book makes me want to take a vacation to Italy.  The author is fantastic at painting a picture in my head, and his characters are so vividly described that it's hard to finish the book and leave them behind.

The story is amazing, as always.  Just the right amount of difficulty without angst.  The kind of book you read as you're making dinner because it's too good to put down.  If you've read the author's books before, you know you're getting a good one.  If you haven't, you need to!",Take an imaginary trip to Italy with characters you'll really enjoy
3889,This is a well-written and engaging book that gives great insight into the conditions experienced by Central American immigrants during the long and dangerous journey to the United States and what they hope will be a better life. Martinez also explores the many negative impacts on Mexican society brought about by the increasing involvement of narcotics cartels in the immigration pipeline.,A thorough exploration of the immigrant situation in Central America
3890,"For history and sociology buffs, this historical fiction provides so much insight into the lifestyles of those in the developed world in the World War I era. I gained insight into life under the czar and how and why the Russian Soviet Revolution garnered so much support.

Look forward to reading more from you.,I love Scottish stories and time travel mixed together is a great blend
3892,"The best book I've read to date on the differences between Catholics and Protestants. There is no ""fat"" in this book. There is just enough detail to explain the essentials of the differences, but not so much as to be tedious. Very easy to read and understand. Covers all the major issues well. I recommend that all Catholics and Protestants would be much better informed about their beliefs after reading this book. I am very glad I read it, and will keep it as a future reference.",Excellent discussion of differences between Catholics & Protestants
3893,"Different perspectives from each character adds a uniqueness to this mystery novel that I find very enjoyable.  Our heroine is also a rather unique police officer that is learning as the story progresses.  By the time I got to.the final chapters, I found it hard to put the book down.  A good read that I highly recommend.",Unique individual characters' perspectives makes this novel really stand out.
3894,"A good place to start with David Whyte. For me, his audio recordings are in another league. He goes all the way up and all the way down. Totally alive. A true guide for living a human life. I never in my life expected to fined someone functioning at this level and able to articulate what that might mean. If you are ready he can meet you. If you are window shopping don't bother.",An extraordinary presentation for the person who is ready to hear it.
3895,"Kind of interesting, but really just a bunch of disjointed, somewhat repetitious speculation about things that might or might not happen in the future.  A somewhat more analytical (and a little bit more skeptical) approach would have been much more interesting, because it would have let the reader actually think about the likelihood of some of these things happening.  Plus, the author seems hopelessly naive about the ability of our politics and government to control some of the rather frightening scenarios envisioned.","Pretty pure rambling speculation, with not much careful thought"
3896,"Anyone who says, ""this book is all about sharing"" has an understanding of this book about as deep as ""the cover is pretty."" This book is about bullying and mutilating yourself because of peer pressure. Anyone who reads this book to an impressionable child gives the message that it's OK to hate anyone who is special. The tachometer on Ayn Rand's grave is spinning.",Let's just hate those who are special--just what kids need to learn.
3897,"This book. I can't even find the right words to say how much I loved it (maybe even a bit more than book 1). It was beautifully written and I absolutely loved Derek and Mia. Their story was heartbreaking, beautiful and so touching. I love that the story felt real. This is an amazing and inspiring story. A story of guilt, love, self forgiveness and second chances.

This story touched our hearts!","Wonderful book to reassure little ones when parents have to leave, for long or short whiles"
3899,"This was definitely a depressing read about a woman living a life she feels very unfulfilled in, but, at the same time, is unwilling/unable to change in any meaningful way.  She sets out on a behavioral path that is certain to destroy her self-image and her life as it is rather than truly seeking medical (chemical) and spiritual/mental help for her issues.  She is overwhelmingly, seriously depressed and should have been hospitalized even before the story's only real tragic occurrence and plot ""twist"".

I also bought the Kindle Version for sharing thoughts on social media and so that I always have the book with me. Recently, I received the audio version which I am listening to for the second time. No regrets other than not having this book available when I was younger. I look forward to sharing this study with my men's group if we ever get through studying Driven By Eternity.

3903,"Based on the strobist dot com website review of this book, I was expecting to get a book that went a step farther than most other books about lighting and photography.  But this book just takes a different point of view, with the majority of pages dedicated to the author writing little stories which explain how he came to be photographing his subject, the locations which were used, and the mindset behind each of the shots.  One thing that this book does much better than others is to describe the planning which goes into site selection and props.","Pretty good, but would ave liked to have seen some lighting diagrams, etc."

I am not particularly religious but these books (Gilead, Home and Lila) really spoke to something in me that I hadn't thought about for many years. There is a depth and spirituality to these novels that doesn't proselytize--something I really appreciate. None of them is a fast read--I probably read every passage at least twice--but truly worth the time it takes.

I'm glad that I did because it fave me great insight into Ms. Clinton's personality, passion for helping children, and a clarity of purpose for her life that we would all be blessed to find in our own lives.

It shows all aspects of the human body in photography along with historical explainations and educational info about the functions of the human body.  The photographs have labeling.  I have anatomy books for doctors, but the photographs in this book are better by far.  I would not recommend it for very young children as it is quite graphic and is of real dead human body parts, but for an older child or even adults, it can be fascinating.",INCREDIBLE PHOTOGRAPHY  Excellent Educational Book for All Ages

Certain things were left undone at the end, and that was a little frustrating when the book was almost 400 pages!

It's very impressive, and I'm reading it slowly, savoring it.",Even great for MEGA-fans of Billy Joel who think they know it all. :)
3952,"First of all ""Mikey"" sounds like a two year old name and his actions were about like that.  The relationship between  Michael and Eva seemed like high school, and they each had too many issues to deal with.  Grammar was also a problem in this novel.  I just hope firefighters and paramedics don't have this much drama in real life!",This book should have been labeled a drama rather than mystery
3953,"This book has a nice collection of songs/poems that I sang as a child in Spain and I had forgotten. I was very impressed by the translations, too. They don't try to go word by word, but rather capture the essence of it and rhyme beautifully. I like to sing the songs in Spanish to my daughter, but even without the music they are excellent.
My daughter's spanish teacher recommended this book as a children poem's book and it has become a favorite in my family.",Beautiful collection and impressive translations of my childhood songs in Spain
3954,It was very interesting in its description of the constituting convention.  I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about the concerns in defining what our government should look like and what powers could be given to the various branches.  It seems that the concerns still exist in today's United States.,An excellent description of the dedicated group at the constituting convention.
3955,"Most people already have their main reason in mind when they visit a place.
The Virgin Islands offer a lot of scuba diving and sailing adventures.
And some people go for the beaches and night life.
But for those spur of the moment things like parasailing or horseback riding, guides like this come in handy.
It's also good for the advice on car rentals and driving tips around the islands.
Fishing, shopping, golf, etc. are all covered.
But the off the beaten path things like hiking are also where Fodor's can come in handy.
Definitely worth having with you.",Handy to have when you want to check out a potential diversion
3956,"Ii is the then 1995 back and forth talk with the future Pope and a well know Rabbi, translated into english in 2013. Gives a insight to what the future Pope thought before he was Pope, A man's heart does not change, even when he becomes Pope. four stars not five cause for some it will be a slow read.

I know a lot of fans love the guys, but I'm giving Rook the stars.  She is really the heroine in this series.

Thank you JA Huss for another exciting series!",how JA Huss put it all together and sucked me right into this world
3958,"It's a lot of hype and an attempt to make ayahuasca seem fun, glamorous, and thrilling, but the book lacks soul.  There does not seem to be an honest reverence for what ayahuasca is used for by the native people (for healing only), but instead a focus on tripping out on ayahuasca and how cool it is to travel to a foreign country to do so.  It also is apparently a good way for the author to promote his ayahuasca tours, which he leads in Peru.","... of hype and an attempt to make ayahuasca seem fun, glamorous"
3959,"I do wish Mr Lancaster would write of more his adventures in the paranormal
as this is one the best written accounts of investigations I have read.  He
has a great way of writing and really gets one involved with what is going on.
He explains all so well.  And what I really enjoyed is hearing about how he
sees and feels regarding hauntings and his perspective of what this all might
be about.  He seems to be one of the more level headed, common sense

3960,"Most of us have chosen our side on the basis of propaganda at worst or incomplete information at best. Our desires and emotional responses are substituted for fact, and we forge ahead. This book removes the veil of ignorance that most of us (including the experts) hide behind and makes us all have to account for the facts. We have 100 years of data to turn to for comparison. This book does just that.",Up Close and Personal with the main characters in the drug war
3961,"The facts are short but amazing. The illustrations and photos are colorful and bright. But there are a few problems for reading to young children. Yes, the copy is short but a few times complicated. And there are a few grammatical mistakes -- VALENTINES DAY should be VALENTINE'S DAY.

But parents and children together can enjoy the illustrations and talk about them. It would be a good learning experience to relate the topics to experiences common to children.",A beautiful little book but some sentences are too tough for young readers-listeners.

3964,"A fascinating journey from a tragic childhood, tracing the heroine's struggle to find her own identity as a woman. After several unsuccessful relationships she eventually finds happiness in a fulfilling relationship. The majority of the book is set in and around Durban, and the author has a fine eye for detail, showing an intimate knowledge of South Africa, its landscapes and its people. Scenes which, in other hands, might have been tawdry, were handled with a surprising sensitivity, each one contributing to the heroine's growth and self-knowledge.","A fascinating journey from childhood to adulthood, set in South Africa"
3965,"I can't believe I bought this.  A physical copy no less!  I typically read others' reviews before pulling the trigger; but apparently not this time.  Two painful pages in, I started skipping through to see if there was any useful information hidden within the rambling, but just... couldn't...do....it.  Pretty sure this was written during a lunch break - and then sent straight to publishing without the ""hassle"" of quality control.  I've never written a poor review; but others need to be warned.  For example:  one of the equipment essentials listed - a fanny pack.  Nuff said.",If you don't have anything nice to say... it must be about this book
3966,"One of my favorite WW II books which is a true eyewitness report by a teenage airborne soldier who was there and then wounded.  While recuperating he penned a memoir which his son many years later found.  The son noting the importance of this only eyewitness account had it published.
It is an excellent read and provides the reader with the true account of American soldier toughness, stubbonness and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.
God bless the American soldier!",An accidental discovery illustrating stubborn American soldiers
3967,"Another exciting Rain book with the usual intro explaining why the titles have changed.  Now if only the intro would give the order of the darn books so I don't have to juggle multiple devices to Google the series every time I want to buy the next book.  Or Amazon could get a better search function.  Seriously, why is it so hard?",Why is it impossible to find the order of the John Rain books?
3968,"Absolutely hands-down, one of the best series I have ever had the pleasure of reading!! This whole series is absolutely amazing! I see some people have left some negative comments and I have to ask what were you reading? This was entertaining, this was sad, this was beautiful, it had a little bit of everything.

One very satisfied reader right here!","Absolutely hands-down, one of the best series I have ever had the pleasure of reading!!"
3969,"This book had so many nutty writing, POV, and formatting issues that I wanted to hate it, but the characters were endearing--even if stolen straight from Ghost Adventures and Paranormal State. Very much enjoyed the resolution. Refreshingly not what I'd expected, but story aside, the book would GREATLY benefit from a thorough copy edit.","Too many typos and TV rip-offs to count, but still a fun read!"
3970,"I thought this was done very well, in story form, font sIze, as well as illustrations wise in a fun educational way. So, if I may, I wish to not only rate it as a five star kids ebook but also to recommend this for those ages 3-6 & or in grades P-K.

3972,"I liked the strong women in this story. I like the vulnerability of the lives who are affected by the mermaids and their kind. I enjoyed the development of the characters, the sharp plot turns, the intelligence of the evolving character connections and resolutions to conflics.

Not a flirty read filled with fanciful sirens but a good, solid story with believable characters. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.","Strongly written story, well developed plots, very nice read."
3973,Interesting romance premise with a touch of mystery and magic thrown in. It was a quick read that kept me turning the pages well into the wee hours of the morning!

I liked that she was strong when she needed to be and vulnerable when it was appropriate. She did not break down when her family is attacked but fought hard to get them back. I look forward to more stories featuring Alexis as the main character","This book was funny and did not make the female character a weak, whinny woman."
3978,"Rather quickly I had a bad taste in my mouth for  Robert Fitzpatrick and found myself rooting for the bad guys. In fact, I started wondering who the bad guys were and then decided that both sides were equally corrupt.

3981,"I have now read all 5 of French's Dublin Murder Squad novels.  I started out intrigued by the characters and the settings. However, as the series progressed, the stories became darker and more difficult to read.  Although The Secret Place reunites the reader with favorite characters from earlier in the series, this story was disappointing.  Too much detail in describing clothing and settings made the pace of the story line slow.  Further, the ending did not provide denoument.  Perhaps this was a segue to a 6th book.  If so, I certainly won't read it.",Although The Secret Place reunites the reader with favorite characters from earlier in the series
3982,Appear to be a written for movie action series that could make an exciting movie but is very unrealistic in the written form.

It is a shame we were never given an opportunity to hear that voice from the Oval Office...I wish they would make audio and video versions of this, but given the time elapsed since the publishing of this book and Cuomo's low profile these days, sadly, the best we can do is his words. Of course, they are more than just mere words.","A great collection from the most eloquent progressive voice from the ""Age of Reagan"""

3985,"Death is a hard topic to write about and equally hard to read about. Having lost my mother and father, this brought out quite a bit of emotion. I have to admit even the memories of Connor's dog dying made tears.

It's a credit to an author to be able to bring out such sadness in a novella. Suen did a wonderful job making it clear not to hold grudges against family - one day they might not be there to make up with.

4018,"I thought the Silver Suitcase was though provoking. It sort of follows a granddaughter's life while we simultaneously discover the life of her grandmother. It was cleverly written and kept my attention. Perhaps the epilogue could have been less obvious about it's Christian objective but I did not mind.  After reading the Silver Suitcase, I gave some thought about what legacy I would leave my children and grandchildren.

4019,"Slaughter gives a thriller that shocks with its violence. The characters, though, you love.  Will, Faith and Sara all work together to solve these horrendous crimes, and you'll love them for the professionals they are. What I found a little hard to believe that Will's dyslexia was as bad as portrayed with his advancement in the GBI. Faith helping him along as she did was a little too ""woman gotta help this man"" for me. Of course she had her own problems, and they worked together well.

4023,"I thought a novel by a Pulitzer Prize winning author would have more to offer. It does give the reader a rather vivid picture of Indian culture and heritage as experienced by a family transplanted in the USA, but the book is more like reading a mere chronicle of a person's life.

4028,"I know so much more about point of view after reading this book, and the exercises will be useful. There were a few places where I wished the author had given more detail, but some material is self-limiting and I don't expect to find absolutely everything in a single book.

In the process, a book that would qualify for 4 or 5 stars is lost as he loses the narrative, pacing, and logic of the plot.  Although I rated this book 3 stars, I could easily rate it only 2 starts.  If only Mr. Thor would have taken an extra two or three weeks to do it right.

I was actually really excited to see how this book would change up the dystopian-esque themes and for the most part it was a great road trip/coming of age YA novel. I felt like the world building was lacking quite a bit. There were small hints about things going crazy, but for the most part the world hadn't changed much.

4037,"All I can say is 'wow.'  The mental image I've always had of the Dust Bowl was that it was a single incident, one huge dust storm, a catastrophic event that destroyed farms, livestock and forced people to go West in search of a better life.  I never understood that the dust storms went on for years, and I always thought the storms were contained within the South and the Midwest, but at one point, the dust storms reached Manhattan and even ships that were out at sea.

This is the very first book by this author that disappointed me.  There is way too much going on from so many directions in this far fetched story, that it is just too unbelievable.  Next time, I think I'll wait for it via the local library and not risk losing $11 like I did with this one :-(",Very disappointed in this book from one of my favorite authors.

It was hard to try and keep track of so many different species all at the beginning, I don't even know if I can remember them all and I just finished. It was a long novel but then it suddenly ended right in the middle of the rebel war just as The Captain was on her way to free the slaves on the moons, so that was a bit confusing.

4042,"Hunter was so possessive and superior and he drove me insane. And Jesse gave into him so easily even though he basically spent all of his time telling her how things were going to be. And they know almost nothing about each other and seem to have nothing in common, yet they are ""in love"". Really all of the men in the book were very condescending to the female characters. Example: when missions are ""too dangerous"" they don't allow any women to go.
I also thought the dialogue was a bit stilted over all.",Overly possessive men and a lack of relationship development.
4043,"This story is filled with valuable references to great books and authors.  Giving it credibility.

The shocking depravation and sacrifice of these women puts into light how difficult the war was on the Russian people and the Russian Troops.

I have the feeling that the author wrote a nice short story about this period, maybe got encouraged from his writing group, and tried to make it a novel. Without a single new idea.

Having said this the characters are really good and well written and make the story a 5 and not a 4. At no time was I left thinking who was that or which character was that.  Morgan is kind of your normal girl that didn't feel like she was doing what she really wanted with life.

Using reading strategies wasn't even mentioned when I was in school (that was a long time ago) but it applies to the little kids that are in this classroom and all of us.  I have found that when I started using some of these strategies myself my reading pleasure and understanding have both jumped.,If you like or een don't like to read this will make your reading experience more enjoyable.
4054,"This story had me guessing what was going to happen from the start. Figuring some things out happened, but twists kept being thrown in to alter the outcome just enough. The characters were interesting, eccentric and, strangely, funny. The end was so exciting, nail-biting and anti-climactic that it made the story a success.

4068,"Great book but just one suggestion, the book is a bit heavy due to it being 600 pages. The thing about big books is that it becomes harder to read due to the binding. For example, if you have a book that is 600 pages, it makes an awkwardly high reading position and it creates an awkward platform where you have to keep pressing the pages down. Perhaps if this was split in half (i understand there could be a cost issue) the book could be easier to bend down to read and it probably wouldnt kill our backs.","Good Material but bad Book Design (Book physical structure, not content)"

4142,"Comparable to '20th century guns' by Miller, but is more comprehensive and detailed. Profiles weapons that would likely be encountered by military of law enforcement officials, so it is tilted towards more modern weaponry (1960+), Good detail, though not complete for a military historian looking for facts about usage (when/where used) or more in-depth ballistic info.",Good firearms reference guide for modern weapons and those encountered by the police
4143,"I have read 95% of Ross Thomas' books and this is as good as any of them, better than most, near the top, actually.  This story is not only outrageous, it's absurd and that's just the names of the characters. The town and what happens there is true fantasy, unless you live in Detroit or Chicago or some other City that's seen its share of corruption.  Really, if you give yourself over to the story you will enjoy it.",... 95% of Ross Thomas' books and this is as good as any of them
4144,"Oh Freya, what can I say about this girl. She's so unpredictably crazy.

I love the relationship between Viktor and her, it's so funny the crap they do to each other.

Anton had me pissing myself with his antics I'm glad he's getting a story he deserves one.

I love the brotherhood of these men they maybe #dicks to each other but they've will always have each other backs.

4145,"Drew Hayes writes engaging stories, they normally start a bit slow, then build up to a satisfying denouemont; Forging Hephaestus falls in to this pattern, there are some fairly slow sections in the first half, the second half makes it worthwhile.

As usual from Drew there is good writing, an interesting world, with a logical premise that takes a bit to really shine. Between this and his other series in the parahuman genre (Super Powereds, Corpies) the author has written some excellent stories.

It is also the first book that left me hoping for more interesting idioms. That is quite a feat.","As usual from Drew there is good writing, an interesting world"

4147,"I would recommend this novel to anyone interested in cultural differences and the ability to overcome adversity.  It was very interesting, told from the point of view of a female member of an oppressive society.  It provides insight into the day to day lives of people living under the rule of the Taliban.  I thought the story was told in a straight forward manner providing insight into life in a very different culture with very different values from the U.S.  I thought the ending might have been too good to be true to life, but satisfying nonetheless.",Insight into the day to day lives of people living with the Taliban
4148,"I, a male, small-time hobbyist-painter, bought this as a guide to early 20th century, upscale women's wear.  It works well for its intended purpose.  But in addition <Vintage Fashions> is chock full of excellent color photos, 2 or 3 to a page.  They show a half-dozen or so youngish, drop-dead-gorgeous, live models wearing beautiful, expensive outfits from that period.  (They probably have good minds too).",I'm probably the only male amoung these reviewers.  I like the book a lot.
4149,"When I finished the last Daniel Silva novel, I vowed that I would never read another Gabriel Allon novel.  Too much violence, much of it seemingly senseless.  Look at what our world has become!  Even though Silva claims that this is a work of fiction, it could be a perfect mirror for our world today.  I hear the same headlines, when I watch the morning news these days.  Imagination and reality have merged.  It makes for a good novel, scary reality.  Maybe things will calm down, when the US presidential election is over.  Who knows what will be the focus of Silva's next novel?",THE BLACK WIDOW - Along Came a Spider...too close for comfort

There are several popular Sci Fi movies that are loosely based on his novels and short stories (Such as Blade Runner and Total Recall).

I enjoy everything I read from Mr Dick, and also enjoy the films based on his work.",Philip K Dick is one of my favorite authors. He tends to write dark

4164,"A nice, concise history of the causes of the Vietnam war and its major battles. More a review of the forces at work that led to the war and its aftermath than details of individual battles. I wanted a better understanding of this rather than a simple military chronology, so this was overall a good book in this regard.",More of a review of the geopolitical forces at work in the Vietnam war
4165,"I was happy to see another cozy mystery by author Dianne Harman. Love her awesome plots and, of course the delicious recipes at the end of each book.

4166,"I will not reveal the ending, but it is absolutely inconsistent with the characters as well as their professionalism. And it is a cheap way out of the plot -- just abruptly winds up, rather than doing the work of bringing the story to its conclusion. It's like she said ""Oh, look at the time! Got to go."" And it's very, very unfair to the readers, who have invested in these characters -- all of them, but especially Tony and Carol, for many years.","Absolutely terrible ending, spoils the book and the characters."
4167,"First book I've read in this. WOW. !!!!!
You can be sure that I will be reading the rest, for sure!  An absolutely yummy romance!! ( All the words I seem to be able to write are followed by exclamation marks.). Only part I would have changed is Heidi's inability to make up her mind. Frank was an absolute dream of a cowboy.  This is how I would love to have been courted.  If I were an author, I would have wanted  to write stories exactly like this. Hopefully, the rest of this series will be as good!

Later as I began teaching I loaned my copy to a student and subsequently it was never returned. Then in the 70s I paid a few dollars for a paperback copy. Although the replacement with a hardbound copy was expensive, it was well worth it. Fetterman's book is a classic within literature about our Southern Highlanders.","An excellent book, offering an appreciation of why poverty persists in Appalachia.."
4170,I found both Ash and Madness very interesting reading.  I think I liked Madness better because it seemed to have more action.  I was never sure where it was taking me.  I was very sad at one time because I always have an attachment with certain characters.  I am so anxious for the next book in this series to become available.  Really enjoy Jason Brant's books.,I think I liked Madness better because it seemed to have more action
4171,This is a wonderful book for study of both the dispersion of Indian sculptural styles across Southeast Asia and its localisation as it was embraced by local ruling structures.

It has copies of things like concert tickets, letters from Ronald Reagan, a patent on Smooth Criminal shoes, trivia quizes, and even a Mj will and death certificate. A little tacky but I liked it. It's a positive spin on MJ. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I just got the MJ Opus and it cost me $250. Wow! The Opus is fantastic!

4188,"To start this review off I only give it three stars because it arrived in the middle of a very good series. The book in and unto itself is a five star book. What changes that factor is that it should have been told at the beginning (in which it takes place) instead of at the middle because King needs a space filler.

Someone must have medicated Fingal in this book because it's almost as if he's a completely different person.

I'm very glad I did!! It's a well written story about inmates incarcerated in an island prison. It focuses on their feelings, trials, losses and triumphs, and dreams of freedom. I enjoyed how the story line took me through the paces without too much violence or relating how depraved criminals can be!

Unfortunately as is the case with many Kindle books, the OCR process used in scanning is not perfect and so introduces quite a few spelling and word spacing errors.  The book is quite readable, but these errors can be irritating.","A thorough review of the Nuremburg trial, albeit with noticeable scanning errors"
4204,"I've been watching the 5 star reviews come in one after another for this book. So on release day I crossed my fingers, one clicked it and dived right in. I just finished the book and was absolutely not disappointed. If i had to use one word to describe this book, I would say it was about love,  but it was so much more than that. This book is best going into blind, allowing the author to guide you through the book as it unfolds. Just one click it.........d;)","5  ""Love Or Hate; When One Lives In Your Heart, The Other One Dies"" stars........d:)"
4205,"I couldn't be more pleased with the flower patterns in this book.  I am now turning lots of left over yarn into a beautiful garden.  There are all types of patterns, large and small, dramatic and delicate.  Whether you want to put one accent flower on a hat, or turn a whole afghan into a blooming flower bed, this book is what you want.  The directions a re clear and easy to follow.  I also enjoyed the little creatures.  I am sure I will be using this book again and again.",I couldn't be more pleased with the flower patterns in this book
4206,"Less than satisfying story about a teen pregnancy back in the late 70's.  Unmarried mothers were certainly dealt with differently back then.  Her mother dropped her off in a ""facility"" where she was left to deal with her unwanted pregnancy.
This teenage pregnancy then changed her life forever and of course the problem is with how we dealt with those sorts of things then.  Everything was secretive and shameful.",Not very satisfying because a lot of questions have been left unanswered
4207,"I had a real problem with how Clementine dealt with her father's appearance at the hospital. Without a word, or even a moment's concern for how it would affect the poor man, she just took off. Would've been better if she'd explained to him she needed space, rather than causing the poor man more grief, stress and worry. Seemed extremely selfish and childish. I have a hard time imagining anyone would really do that, amnesia or not, it was a needless act of cruelty toward a man who had done nothing to deserve such callousness. Other than that, It was just OK for me.","or even a moment's concern for how it would affect the poor man, she just took off"
4208,"To anyone who wants to understand the TRUTH about how the mechanics of the human body works, this book is for you.  I would advise anyone from the beginner to the true professional to buy this book.

Ellington teaches not only the what... but more importantly the 'WHY'....",Just when I thought I knew everything about bodybuilding & working out....WOW!!!
4209,"Loved the short and sweet book that hits all the major points. Tons of humor and real life experiences make this a very enjoyable read. Seems like author found a way to make a complex issue a simple one. Even simplifying the steps on facing your anxiety.

Only reason for 4 stars is that it felt a bit too simple. Perhaps jt is really that simple. Just the execution is the hard part like he mentioned.",Good primer to deal with anxiety by someone who has been there
4210,"Well written, historically accurate story of colonial Africa's struggle to become independant.

4211,"This story is about a family having to deal with and try to live through the holocaust, while also trying to find all of their family members. You were privy to practically every single thought of the writer.

The genealogy/family tree in the back of the book is also a helpful guide. And I learned what 'Kiddush' is.

It's a great book about history and includes very nice photos. It was well-written, and though just an itsy-bit slow in some spots (just my personal opinion), I enjoyed it, and I do recommend it.",Nonfiction story of a family dealing with the holocaust and trying to find all of their family members

4213,"No need to repeat what other reviewers have said. I think that this is a convincing story and I have actually recommended it to my teenage daughter. There was one chapter in there that was too graphic for me (I don't deal with violence very well), but other than that I would say that this debut is definitely worth reading!",Well written and it gives an honest take on racial issues of that time
4214,"I cannot say enough good about how this book has already helped me with a high-conflict personality in my life. What a HUGE difference and improvement of my relational ability. This book is an excellent, short read. The practical examples are priceless. I highly recommend it to anyone who gets frustrated with persons they encounter who are controlling and intimidating and manipulative. Finally an answer of how to not act like them out of the frustration of their inappropriate behaviors. Thank you Bill Eddy!","Brief, Informative, Friendly and Firm...best book ever to deal with difficult people!"
4215,"As an F. Scott and Gatsby addict, I thought I knew it all. T. Anne Fowler looks into the life of Zelda and spins an amazing tale of love, lust and down fall.
What a life...Hemingway, Dos Passos,Coco Chanel....Paris, New York, Hollywood, Scott and Zelda had it all. Like Gatsby, the green light alluded them in the end.
Bravo to Therese Anne Fowler",No wonder F. Scott was so in love with Zelda. You will fall in love as well.
4216,"Pattie Boyd truly lived an extraordinary life. I appreciated that her tone was very matter-of-fact -  no drama, flowery language or air of self-importance.  She was just a girl with an unconventional childhood who met some interesting people and fell into a famous crowd.  Definitely worth a read if you're at all interested in the era.",Such an Interesting Read - Enjoyed Pattie's Humility Throughout
4217,"Original, well-written take on an established premise (bored, unfulfilled princess wants to be seen as a person, not her title).

CLEAN, appropriate for young teen readers and older.",Very sweet romance - although the path is interesting and developed
4218,"I learned a great deal by reading about how the South Africans adapted their doctrine and tactics based upon terrain and how the enemy operated.  Their integration of vehicles, trackers and helicopters to intercept guerrillas in the bush is worth the price of the book.  Very well written and informative.  They also successfully fought conventional Cuban forces equipped with Soviet armor.  Our armed forces can learn a lot by studying these operations.",ADAPTIVE PRACTICAL AND HARD FIGHTING SOLDIERS AGAINST AMAZING ODDS
4219,Had so many themes. Written extremely well. Arab and American relationships over decades. History. Love and betrayal and human psychology. Emotions. Families. Stunted emotional development. Sex.

4220,"I am still wondering what the Critical Error was, exept that I spent my money and time on this book.  For instance (SPOILER ALERT...partly) a critical part of the book is that a huge chunk of Texas is given up, and Isreal manages to buy it and move the entire nation there without anyone noticing until it's done.  Completely implausable.  There are several parts of this book like this, which just undermines the good parts too much.","Some good Special Forces stuff, but the plot is weak, weak, weak"
4221,"Suffer the Little Children is my favorite of Donna Leon's books at the moment. It involves twists in a fascinating  story revolving around a man whom people saw often, but no one seemed to know him.  Everyone has to reconsider what they said, felt or did, including Inspector Brunetti and his wife, as the story unfolds very slowly.",Suffer the Little Children is my favorite of Donna Leon's books at the moment
4222,"Very easy to use. Nice format.  All the prayers follow the format of his other book, BEFORE THE AMEN.  If you're looking for a place to start working on your prayer life or daily devotionals, I would recommend this book.

They're very applicable to daily life.",A nice place to get started/recommitted on one's spiritual growth journey
4223,"The Tragedy of King Lear is a gem with keen insights into the ways that people can be superficial at their own peril and the peril of those they love. Unfortunately, I read the Kindle version. As with many Kindle books that involve formatting, the playscript was very difficult to follow due to  erroneous breaks in the lines of text. Read King Lear as a physical book.",One of Shakespeare's takes on the parent-child relationship. Read it as a physical book.
4224,"This is a very easy to read and very easy to pick up book.  It will not put you off but I think there are some misses in that it tries to introduce the idea of the main character's strengths as a given.  and maybe because of the commercials for Nicolas Hoult's zombie movie, this story is very easy to visualize.  I recommend it because it is entertaining and painless to pick up e.g. as airplane or dmv queue reading.",written in a voice of isolation reminiscent of Orson Scott Card

It kept talking about her deep dark secret. I did not feel this could be a romance novel, with all that anger she holds up. It had the character hold her breath several times to keep her temper down.

Maura's naive about life and love due to the kind of upbringing she's had. But I think she truly figures out who she is and what she wants along the crazy ride she finds herself on.

We met every other week and would focus on one chapter and thus, one discipline per week and then meet and discuss the chapter and discussion questions. It was a great way to do the study and I got a lot out of it and this book! I would really recommend it as a bible study as well as a good read!

The Fall of Arcadia is a sci-fi/fantasy/paranormal romance novella and is the prequel to The Prophecy of Arcadia series.

I doubt an editor was employed. An intriguing concept however not original from the author's imagination because it is true; there was such an apartment found.

A first-person present-tense feverdream, equal parts Raymond Chandler and Bret Easton Ellis. Drugs and crime, political coups and sex workers, and blood, and blood, and blood.

Visit a locale you may not have literarily been to before. The humidity and corruption of the place actually seeps from the printed words into your soul. You're tasting the fish soup and pollution as you devour page after page, even when it starts to make you feel a bit sick.

Of course, Both Bush Terms are missing and Obama's tenure is not included in the book...Given this, it is merely a partial history book of American Presidents.

There is a constant flow between buried space ship parts, times and reconstructed  bodies through three books -- this is the second -- with the global aspects awaiting in the third.  The plagues and viruses, coincidental meetings, evil characters with pure motives, and love themes that run through the books became exceedingly tiresome.

I made him an Explorer kit, including a compass and a magnifying glass to go with it. The fact that it is the story of a real boy means that my grandson will have an interest in Einstein firmly planted in his young mind and heart. I think it could lead to reading more about Einstein as he grows older. And it will be so much fun to help him explore the world around him like a little budding scientist/explorer.",Great book to open up the world of both science and imagination
4243,"There's some really cool worldbuilding in this book. Spires made of living bone. An interesting caste-like system of job assignments. Flying through the clouds. But, I found I had more questions that were never answered about the world.

I listened to this book in audiobook format and it took me awhile to finish it. I couldn't really get into the book. There were many slow parts.

Overall, it was a fun, enjoyable book. But, it could have been so much more. I give this book a 3/5.","Really interesting worldbuilding, but it didn't get my attention"
4244,"Took me to a place I have never been before and proved quite the page-turner. Yes, the plot is murky, and yes, the hero is a bit passive and uncompelling, but the intriguing well-etched atmosphere, layers of cynical social irony, and escalating sense of mystery and threatening unpredictability keeps the suspense factor up until the wholly paradoxical denouement. I enjoy this writer in that he combines elements of Robert Stone, Jean Le Carre, and Ian Fleming. As expressed elsewhere in these reviews, much better than what is standard in this genre.","Elements of Robert Stone, Jean Le Carre, and Ian Fleming in a suspenseful journey into the spooky depths of Cuba"
4245,"This wasn't a fast paced book. It does require brain power. You pitt yourself against a real brain teaser. I took a couple breaks from it's intensity and read a light romance.

So it is scary for youngsters (and us), but then presents practical and fun ways to help live sustainably at home, school, and in the community.

4248,"Aside from the lack of proofing, bad grammar, and numerous spelling mistakes, this book almost no plot.  What plot there is is buried under a mass of non sequiturs.  If a spelling check was run on the text, it was done without reference to meaning (e.g., using ""poll"" when ""pole"" obviously was meant).

4251,"Absolutely perfect. It goes over every letter of the alphabet and is very straight forward and readable in its lay-out and instructions. My one problem is that the book spends quite some time trying to describe the SOUNDS the letters make, and this is just not possible to do in a book.

Well researched, it offers valuable insights into the Irish roots of Joe Kennedy and his determination to beat a class system which eschewed Irish immigrants as second class citizens. I read things here I'd never read before and was so fascinated I couldn't put the book down till I'd read the whole thing.

4271,"A gritty read. I admit to not being able to put it down once I started.  A stark commentary on life for the working poor and what happens to those who slip through the cracks. Especially the cracks created by greedy and powerful individuals with no thought to the lives of the men and women they destroy. All revolving around the search for a possible serial killer... or is he a guardian angel? You will find hopelessness and hope, bitterness and joy within these pages.

It's a compulsion, a deeply ingrained way of thinking, or just how our brains work (screwed up I know, but we NEVER choose this for our selves). It is NOT something we can just ignore, push aside, or incorrectly dismiss as some sort of sexual fetish that should be kept hidden at all costs.

However, if you want to use the color guides in the margin, this separates them from the drawing. This is the reason that I have rated 4 stars; it's hard to keep the pages connected in order to use the color guide.

4335,"The author hits the ground running and then next thing you know, you've reached the end.  It is a collection of unusual and shocking happenstances for the journalist.  While the stories aren't really related in a through and through storyline, they do come together to give a very real (seeming) account of a ""day in the life"" in Congo.  The fact that the author was always hustling to find and sell stories back in the West gave the experience a relatable tone.  A nice divergence from such day to day accounts from mission trips and NGOs.",Quick and Dirty Dive into Life in the Congo for a Modern Journalist
4336,"Kristen Harnisch has created a very compelling character in Sara Thibeault, a brave, self-possessed, intellectually curious young woman unwilling to bend to social convention. While her story is set in the unique and historical world of vintners in late 19th/early 20th century France and California, it has universal appeal as a story of tradition and rebellion, family and secrets. The setting itself, meticulously researched, adds a delectable layer to the story, making for a thoroughly enjoyable read.","Tragedy, romance, history and vineyards with a very compelling heroine"

4340,"Sorry, could not quite finish it.  No question about the sophistication of this novel novel, just the masterwork of an extremely literate man.  My quibble?  Just too much intellectual effort is required to appreciate it.  When I realized just how much of the prose was actually doubling as poetry a la William S Burroughs, I realized that my search for my next light reading before bedtime book needed to be resumed....",Rewarding but challenging -- not the best relaxing bedtime reading material
4341,"I became so sad when reading that boy's words! It was if he had been addressing them to me! Then I read on and realised how some simple words have the power to hold one's life. To such an extent that you're no longer able to recognise the truth about yourself. This is a book about learning to live and respect yourself, to love yourself again, a book about breaking free from the former negative image you held about yourself, from the negativity coming from all around us. It is a book of struggle and, finally, a book of rebirth! Wonderfully written!",Discovering the truth behind the lies is a liberating experience!!
4342,"Why not mention in the description of the book that it has religious undertones. I have a very shaky relationship with organized religions view of the maleness of God, and would have appreciated knowing prior to purchasing the book that the author believes that the love of his God is what allows him to live his ""secretly incredible life in an ordinary world.""

Others may love it, but for me, at least right now, religion is a turn off, as is hiding the fact that it resides as a theme within a book from the description.",Why no mention of God or religion in the description? Would have made it much easier.
4343,"I loved this book...first one from this author that i read and i sooooo enjoyed it. Both main characters are fantastic. Snappy & witty dialogue really sets this book apart from a lot i have read lately. As soon as i finished it, i purchased the next 3! A real bonus of this book is the focus on a kitten who takes up residency at Mikes place. In fact this series is very focused on responsible pet ownership and thats a wonderful thing to promote!

4345,"This was the book that made me realize that Caldecott Medal is given more for the pictures and illustrations in a book, not so much the writing, which is poor. Illustrations are pretty good, and even tho I really want to give it one star, they deserve more than that. Still not worth buying.

4346,"I have mixed feelings about this work; I both love it for the content and hate it because it was Bukowski's last novel, signaling the ""passing of an era,"" if you will. An old fashioned detective story full of metaphors relating to the writer's impending death and his fashion of dealing with the demise. A poignant farewell from one of the world's greatest story tellers.",An excellent curtain call for one of the twentieth century's most influential authors.
4347,"This is by far the most informative, and level-headed book on this most complicated country I have ever read. The bonus is that it reads like a long history novel filled with action and human drama even though the contents of this book would easily beat any academic books ever written on the country.

This is a book to be read, and reread by all those interested in the region.

I just wish that this book was published earlier so that I could understand the situation of the DRC before going there to work.","The most well-researched and balanced book on the Congo, and it reads like an action-filled drama"
4348,"I enjoyed reading The Fix, by Liam Vaughn, very much. As a retired financial advisor, I enjoy reading about books like this one, which point out some of the inner workings of the world's financial system.  Most non-fiction books on this topic, with the exception of those by Michael Lewis, are usually interesting, but a little dry. Not this one. I read almost like a financial thriller, like one written by Michael Sears.  Vaughn does a great job explaining the LIBOR scandal, and how a handful of greedy banksters manipulated the system.  Highly recommended",Fascinating expose of how big banks manipulated the world banking system

I'm one of those people who are memory challenged thanks to a stroke, I'd have to re-read it to give an accurate synopsis of the book, but just believe me, it's a page (okay, button) turner.

4352,"My daughter was coming into our room night after night, so I bought this book. It gives ideas of things to be afraid of and doesn't encourage or really help Ed learn that he could do it.

This is simply a supplement and something that is easy to throw in the van and have the kids work on (or test each other) on car rides.  It is very thin (70 pages of actual activities).

I would recommend this to anyone that wants to understand how our words impact our lives and how changing them can change where we go in life.  I loved the fact that this is written from a biblical perspective.

The writing is captivating, with lyrical descriptions that don't tread into the grotesque when it comes to more erotic scenes. The tension between Anna and Mozart when they first meet was a true delight, and the love that develops between them was profound.

As with all good historical fiction, the author has clearly done her research. She brings an age to life so vividly, and crafts such a lovely story, that I'm looking forward to her sophomore effort. I'll be sure to buy it!",Fantastic book -- the beautiful escape you've been looking for

There was some bad language (not crude, think Patton) but not out of character for a military sci-fi. A  good mix of battle scenes and story line.

Landis' book is superb by comparison and excellent by itself. It is cogent and clear, well organized, the charpters divided into clear sections and subsections, with numerous examples with straightforward and simple math; it has a glossary and an index, lacking in Murphy's (apparantly self-published) book.

Because I read so much, people ask me for book recommendations, so I started my own 1 to 5 book rating spreadsheet in 2007. I really enjoy L.J. Sellers books but this one only got a 3 1/2 on my personal rating scale. That means it was OK but not a page turner for me.",My reading is all action adventure books like those written by Michael Connelly
4397,I read this one a long time ago and remember having the feeling of just finishing a short from the Robot series. It left the feeling that it needed more and yet the novel is complete. Far from a bad novel but with there being so much better out there I suggest this one is left to the fans or for those with short attention spans!,A good read but short and far from the quality of his other works
4398,"Macintyre lives up to his well-earned reputation with this one. He has become one of my top ten authors. His research for ""ancient"" biography is amazing. The characters come alive as does their action. There are chills and spills and many laughs as the story develops. It's a very good read about a master thief whose antics are often quite unexpected but never life-threatening. He exhibits leadership and a gentlemanly approach toward everyone including his arch rival with whom he occasionally sits and has a pleasant chat. You'll have fun with this one!","If they ever make a movie of this one, Pierce Brosnan must be cast in the title role!"
4399,"I enjoyed reading the escapades and could identify with the fathering in this family! Tried to read more from this author - thought Money Ball would be a good choice, seeing as they had made it into a movie, but could NOT get into that book at all! I'll try something else from this author though, for sure.",Great funny and truthful book to share with parents of all ages!
4400,"Thank you Dannah Gresh and Juli Slattery for honoring God's call to write this book.  This book looks at a topic many women - especially those in the church- are afraid to discuss.  This a great book about God's perfect plan for sex in marriage,  how God intended sex. There is insight on sexual healing. This is primarily written as a response to Fifty Shades of you know what. But it opens up a discussion many women are afraid to have.  This book is well thought out and was clearly prayed out.  Great insight on a sensitive topic.  Check out the book for the start of a movement!!",Finally...A Christian Response and the start of a movement! (Hopefully!)
4401,Starting to get tired of reading about everyone they know and love getting killed. I decided that I needed to take a break from the series for now. It was making me too depressed. BUT just because I'm taking a break and tired of reading about all the death in the books does not mean that it is a bad series. I've really enjoyed reading a lot of it. It just seems that there is too much death for them and the bad guys are getting all the luck.,Good series so far but needing to take a break from all the death.
4402,"As a Healing Arts Practitioner who works with children and teens, I was delighted to find this oh-so-sensible approach to working with kids. I have already started to use the questions approach Warburton recommends and can attest to its effectiveness.  It's fun to see the wheels turning as the kids stretch their minds to answer the questions. It stretches my mind to ask the questions! The examples given throughout help concretize the concepts. It's great to have this resource to recommend to parents. I wish I had had the benefit of Warburton's expertise when I was raising my own kids.",Great resource for parents and for professionals who work with kids
4403,"A friend of mine had read this book and told me I had to read it. I started reading it and couldn't put it down. Had it completely read in 2 days. It is so interesting. Ties American history in with the Bible and events that have happened recently in our country also. Reading this had the hair standing up on my arms, it was so good! Good reading for anyone!!",A must read for anyone who is interested in the history of America and Bible prophesy
4404,"From start to finish good, good, good!!! I've read all 3 in this Series - Ribbons of Steel.
Without a doubt Promise for Tomorrow was the best of the 3 books.  keeps you in it all  the way through and what an ending!!! Great storyline, characters.  I would
recommend it to anyone looking for a good Christian novel.  It gets a bit wordy here & there but besides that a really good book, as were  the other 2.","Definitely a Must Read for those wanting Drama, Love & a Really Good Christian Novel"
4405,Perhaps the best single source of technical information on the missile and its operation that I've been able to find. Lacking only up to date scale drawings to make it complete. Plenty of photos of the details and related support equipment make it the perfect source for technical or scale model entheusiasts.,Now the best single source for technical and photo details of the V-2
4406,"Okay, well, I claimed this book was an emetic in the book title, but actually it is so much more than that: a somnolence aid, and the ultimate in posthumous self-aggrandizing ego stroking. Better yet, if you want to lower your libido and numb your soul, read this book!

 P.S. The Hilton San Francisco suuuuuuucks!!!!!!",Shameless Hilton self-aggrandizement--an emetic in the form of a book
4407,"I agree that this story is a bit difficult to review precisely because the characters are so easy to loathe. I don't think there's one character I could sympathize with or like. Could these people really exist? They most definitely do. And they all love themselves as much as these people do.  However, the story itself is written pretty well. The back and forth, the interweaving, of the various story lines is a bit frustrating. It stretches it out until the plot is almost thin. Almost. Not one of my favorite books but I would recommend it to others.",Well written story about loathsome characters - I guess that's just like real life.
4408,"This is a book that EVERYONE should read, but especially BEFORE raising children.  The life lessons learned, and meaningful lessons to share with and teach your children are extremely important!!!!!  I haven't even finished the book, as it is very rich with life lessons, and best absorbed in sections, however I already see it's amazing value!  The reasons to impart and adopt more discipline are made so clear, while a person's ability to function, and make decisions in life will be made so much easier after the process is made so simple and clear.",An AMAZING Book of Life Lessons - A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE!!!!!
4409,"This account of Mohammed is based upon the foundational documents of Islam, not speculation or opinion  It readily lends itself to fact checking for anyone wishing to do so.  The author writes in a very straight-forward, informative manner, allowing the reader to draw his or her own conclusions. I read the short (136 pages) book in just a few days.  Given the great influence of Islam throughout the world, everyone should gain an understanding of the Prophet Mohammed, how he lived, understood the world, and what he taught his followers.",Straight-Forward Account of the Life of Mohammed and His Teachings
4410,"Overall I liked this story, a quick easy read that kept my attention.  It will take awhile to get used to the fact that each chapter you are bouncing between past, present and a diary - it's tricky at first to remember where you are in time and/or if you're reading from the diary - I would not recommend this for a teen reader ONLY because of this fact!  The author could do with a better editor IMO, lots of grammatical issues (i.e. the constant use of the word 'just' in sentences and lots of sentences starting with the word ""And"").  I still would recommend this book to a friend.",Good story that keeps you wondering how it'll all tie together.
4411,"This book, although simple and straightforward, should be required reading for anyone starting their quest for wealth. I have read hundreds of self help and wealth conscious development books (and I feel they have paid off greatly) but this book covers the basics very well. I would recommend this book to any beginning or intermediate reader.",Should be one of the first 5 books you read on your quest for wealth
4412,"Having read a number of Elizabeth George's novels involving the Inspector Linley character it was important to read this offering as it clears up a number of issues relating to Tom Linley's relationship with those close to him who are featured in other novels.  To do so George has managed to include a well thought out mystery involving a murder and mutiliation and wend her way through the investigation to include members of his family and close friends.  All in all a good read that fleshes out the various characters of the ""Linley Mysterys"" series and explores their relationships.",This book ties up a number of loose ends in Tom Linley's life as well as providing a good mystery.
4413,"LOVE LOVE LOVE  I couldn't put this down at night!  I have never been to Europe, but through Rosamunde Pilcher's beautiful, crafty and very clever ways of allowing you into the lives of her characters, I can almost smell those ocean. To picture the houses, elaborate or tiny cottage be it, it's as if you can feel the warmth or cold in the room.  I love the people she creates, honestly... they become so real and so intricate in their own personality.","LOVE THIS BOOK! Love not wanting to put it down and sleep, hate turning the last page."
4414,"I thoroughly enjoyed this and will probably continue the series later on. While I wished for more attention to certain characters development, I still think Shusterman did a fantastic job at showing the changes of his three main characters. He also touched on a lot of very controversial topics in this novel, from abortion to adoption, with some disturbing scenes that definitely make you question humanity.",I thoroughly enjoyed this and will probably continue the series later on
4415,"How much fun can be packed into 1 book. I don't know, but Earthman jack has set the bar pretty high. I caught myself several times forcing myself to slow down. The story was so compelling and exciting that I was reading as fast as I could to keep up with the non-stop action. I enjoyed this book on so many levels: strong character development, unique story concepts, and a fascinating universe on which the story is staged. If you love adventure, fast paced action, and characters that you can love and relate to , this book is for you.",I was readying as fast as I could to keep up with the non-stop action.
4416,This book is absolutely amazing! Thanks so much Adam for all you do as a true patriot and defender of freedom. To understand the world we must first understand the power structure that uses force against us every day to uphold their will against the people of the earth. Adam does an incredible job of dissecting statism and the power structures of today and providing the implications apparent in our daily lives. He also outlines thoughtful solutions and the true power found in freedom. Can't wait to read this again tonight!,"Realize your full potential in the human experience, support FREEDOM"
4417,"I ate this book up! I was transported to when the boys came home from WWII and felt like part of the family. When I discovered Love Comes Home was the third book in the series, I zipped over to Amazon and bought the first two.

It's a must read!",I was transported to when the boys came home from WWII and felt like part of the family
4418,"Comprehensive and mind-boggling.  Qualifications - patience, protocol, public relations, exceptional. expertise in management.  Last but not least, compassion for those affected.

4419,"My 9 year old is a little reluctant to discuss puberty and stuff, which is understandable, so I was skeptical about how we would respond to this book.  Luckily, he was very excited to get it, as it concentrated more on your body and what happens to it, instead of sex and opposite sex puberty.  It has a lot of good, straightforward advice on how to be your healthiest self, and with just the right amount of humor to keep it light.  He finished reading it in just a couple days, and is excited to learn more.","Great book, especially for the younger guys (like 10 and under)"
4420,"My daughter and I read this book together and enjoyed it immensely! It was a great story full of magic, friendship, and childhood angst. It kept my interest even though I am an adult, and my daughter thought it very funny. Not only was this fun to read with my daughter it was a good conversation starter about how things are going for her at school. We can't wait to read the rest of the series together.",My daughter and I read this book together and enjoyed it immensely!
4421,"Mysteries are my favorite book style, but some are so stylistically formatted (one chapter now, next chapter back then, rinse, repeat ad nauseum). I like it when an author works harder for my attention even when sometimes the work requires going back some pages to realize how the story is advancing. For me Atkinson keeps me thinking and attentive to the realities of her characters.",I think Atkinson's mysteries either grow on you or they don't.
4422,4.5 because Bugliosi sure can go through those transcripts of trial BUT read this story and it is GOOD- very good always sticks in my head - I can't get over the girl and often think about her - I don't want to do Spoiler alerts or anything but there is a statement someone makes to Bugliosi about her in this book and I often wonder if its true.....very very good- highly recommended,EXCELLENT - I don't know which I like more this or Helter Skelter

A story worth reading for sure",The complicated life of a beautiful English girl in occupied France.
4425,"This book starts off very slowly and for me never really gained much momentum. I did not particularly enjoy the author's writing style and found the characters loathsome and completely unsympathetic. There were no surprises in this novel; I saw every plot ""twist"" coming from the beginning. However, the novel did raise some interesting ideas about a societal collapse that does not involve zombies and I appreciated that. The novel also made for a very lively and fun book club discussion, which is a big plus!","Not my cup of tea, but may be worth a read for apocalyptic fiction lovers."
4426,"I tried REALLY hard to like this book/author but after reading 60%, I had to delete it. I found nothing redeeming. There was virtually no story line, lots of characters in this little town but you can't keep them straight, jumps from one to groups and back. No character development, however. I found it exceedingly boring and don't understand why the author gets such high ratings",I tried REALLY hard to like this book/author but after reading 60%
4427,If you want to be a free thinker and start yourself on the road to freedom then this is the place to start.  It shows how easily a world without government would work.  The hardest part about creating a world where we are free is not building the structure but rather getting rid of the psychotics now in charge.,The world of freedom awaits you only if you are willing to think outside the box
4428,"Aside from everything that all the other reviewers are mentioning...I'll add this.

If you're a trader or investor who ever loses money because of wrong decisions that are triggered by emotional responses to events in the markets, then you should read ""The Complete Turtle Trader."" It will educate and inspire you in a far more profound and visceral way than 99% of the trading psychology books that are on the market.",Covel's true to life Pygmalion story is an inspiration to all of us
4429,"I think it's all the simple plain and clean life they lead that just makes people want to read about them.  even if it's just a fiction love story somewhere parts of that story have to be true.
The stories just always make you feel good this one will too and the choices Carrie will throughout the book.",Their have always been love stories but love stories of the Amish always are the best.
4430,"Straight by Dick Francis was very well written. The story is about a young injured jockey that is called to the hospital
because his brother has been injured in random accident.
The story is very entertaining and has twists and turns as Derrick tries to understand his brothers life and business practices.
He realizes he needs think like his brother in order to stay alive.
I recommend this book!",He realizes he needs think like his brother in order to stay alive
4431,"Before purchasing this book, I had very limited knowledge or background in Ms. de la Falaise. This book does not disappoint as it invites you into a the mind of a creative genius whose daring use of color, fabrics, jewelry, and overall creative expression was very welcomed by a wide range of socialites, rock stars, magazines, fashion lines spanning several continents. A great idea for a gift/coffee table.",Creative Genius delivered through beautiful photographs and attention to detail
4432,"The diciplines set before him and his older brother, by his wise mother, laid the foundation for his accomplishments in schooling.

4433,"I had to read ""Gatsby"" in college, felt it was meh. Read it again in the 1980's, still felt it fell far short of one of America's great novels. Read it again in the 2006, this time with accompaniment with Cliff Notes. Still, underwhelmed. Saw the Leonardo DiCapri ""Gatsby"" and thought the story had a bit more impact as a love story. Maureen Corrigan's book opened my eyes to  many elements I had missed in the past, and I came away with a greater appreciation of Fitzgerald, but still don't believe it's in  the pantheon on America's best literature.",still felt it fell far short of one of America's great novels.

4435,"This book features Tina and Kevin and a group of friends since college.  They continue to party in different places.  The book is very sexual and steamy, but a little slow paced. Some editing problems, but that was because it was an advance reader copy and errors haven't been corrected yet.  No shortage of drama, family tensions or twists.  Lots of drama and social events.  Family funerals and other sad events.  I read an arc of this book and voluntarily chose to review.",This book features Tina and Kevin and a group of friends since college.
4436,"A terrific, moving story of the adventures of, and the relationship between, a Czech airman and his wonderful dog, Antis, who BOTH flew for the RAF in Bomber Command during WWII!  The best book of this kind I have read, surpassing even the story of Judy and her human friend in the Pacific theatre which mostly relates the course of that war, while this one focuses more upon the remarkable relationship between the dog and the man.","Terrific, touching story of the adventures of an RAF gunner and his amazing dog in WW II"
4437,"Love, Love, Love this book. Couldn't put it down.  I am in love with ST7.  This was listed as paranormal and I don't usually read paranormal, but this was wonderful.  Stoked to read the next book in the series.  I really enjoyed the writing style and the plot is excellent.  Interesting background characters make you eager to read the next book and see how the story will unfold.","Superb, Luscious, and Grand-Just read it, you'll like it too!"
4438,"A mystery with a compelling plot, a diabolical and despicable main villain, and the usual amusing banter between Patrick, Angie, and Bubba.  What more could you want?  This was the fifth book in Lehane's Kenzie-Gennaro series, and the sixth, Moonlight Mile, wouldn't appear for another 11 years (2010).  If new to the series, you really must start with the first title, A Drink Before the War.",Enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very last pages

Most of the plots I've read have arrogant H that usually mellow or I stop reading it. However, he did change.  I loved the h and her abilities to fight her attraction to him.  The characters were fleshed out very well.  The children were very much a part of the story and enjoyable.  Altogether a wonderful Emma Lange regency.

Please start writing them again!",A very interesting love story with many characters of interest
4440,"A fast paced writing about murder and mayhem. Sometimes the story is a little confusing as the author is sometimes talking about right now and suddenly you in the past going over a murder scene. There are a lot of characters, all trying to catch the murderer and failing.

4441,"I loved this book. As a software engineer I have several software patents and have a working knowledge of many of the terms, but the author does a good job tying all the terms together and really explaining the true definitions. He gives good examples non-obviousness and novelty...and the case law references do a good job explaining areas/pitfalls we inventors typically ignore..that could ultimately decrease the value of our patents.
If you are an inventor or looking to start..check out this book.",Good book for engineers wanting to get started in the patent process
4442,"A Classic - purchased for a 12 year old who will be able to read it in a day or two because of the larger print.

I love Michael's humor. I often laugh out loud. But this is a serious book, full of mysteries and other worldly powers.
I'll be honest, it took me till 20% of the book to sort things out and proceed with eagerness. Maybe that's just me. But I totally recommend this book, nonetheless.

4445,"As a fan of Kunstler, Orlov, and Greer, I looked forward to reading this book. I am still considering parts of it. Nothing new really for those of us who know something is broke and needs fixing, but for those who focus on the economics portion and haven't really explored these ideas, it is worth checking out. But the economy is only one part of society, and technology and ideology also need to be considered as the other two ""legs"" of our culture, as Leslie White noted.",Economy drives society so we can't leave the economy just to economists
4446,"Roger Carp has written many Lionel Train related books from the history of Lionel to the many products produced by this great company. Roger's knowledge and research of everything Lionel is outstanding. True, many Lionel items have been covered in previous publications, and also true  that often these items are of the rare or exceptional Lionel production. For this publication, Roger focused on trains and sets that the collector of average means might actually acquire and enjoy.
Great narrative, color photos, and Lionel products that we all enjoy!",Nice review of Lionel Trains that are reasonably collectible today!
4447,"I will admit, I was thrown a little in the early part of the book.  The world is so different that some of the thin descriptions just leave you wanting... but that all works out through the rest of the story.  The world, while very different than anything else I've read, builds to an acceptable level and keeps the story focused on the characters.  Overall, a very good read and I don't often offer 5 stars.  I am now reading the second, wondering if it'll take another author to finish this 10 book set as he did for Jordan!  Great books, I hope he keeps them coming!","The world is very different, but the characters are totally human."

I've read Shana Galen's ""When Dashing Met Danger"" (which was phenomenal) so this mediocre novel was a shocking letdown; especially in light of the ratings. The premise, execution, and character development is just sloppy. The protagonists have absolutely no depth as they try desperately to best each other in petulance.

The interpretation of documented historical events is subjective and supportive of the conspiracy theme and conclusions but, due to the period depicted, is not outside the realm of possibility.  Part of the novel, while not giving away too much to the potential reader, replicates actual and speculative events captured by other authors developing novels around similar period courses of events.","Not a book to read in one sitting, but one which keeps you coming back to it."
4455,"Though I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, I was disappointed when it lacked much of the rich subplots portrayed by the television series. I hadn't realized that she had written the script first, and the book second, until I had this book in my hands (which is why it receives a 4 instead of a 5). A very pleasing story but, there is definitely more of it to be told.","Purchased as a gift, but had to get it back to read for myself."

It's a very special time and this book celebrates it with you.,I love the pictures and the descriptive and unique story telling
4459,"This book was a good read but I found that it was written too simple and too short for teen girls.  Teenage girls should be reading extensively.  I actual think that this book should have been for pre-teen girls as my niece is 10 and has no problem at all reading a book like this.  In order to stimulate teenage girls,  I would increase the vocabulary  and the length of the book.  I still rated it 4 stars because of the content and it will help some teenagers who have difficulty reading.

While he was inspired by Tolkien and others who wrote epic fantasy of the traditional sort, Connolly has written a trilogy that moves at a brisk pace, immersing us in the world he has created without laboring over a lot of fluffy stuff (his working title was the tongue-in-cheek ""Epic Fantasy With No Dull Parts"").

4461,"A well written novel of survival from the perspective of a woman who has every reason to wish she were dead. Instead, she overcomes obstacles and plows ahead into whatever awaits her with courage and an inner strength she thought she had lost. This is a very easy read that starts out with a bang and just keeps on delivering. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars only for the fact that at times I felt she was a little unrealistically lucky but that is one of the most endearing aspects of this adventure.","Finally, An Apocalyptic Story Where The Majority of Humans Retain Their Humanity"
4462,"This book had an intriguing storyline that kept me turning the pages. One must accept that the main characters are fictional, but the events and circumstances of the story are based on history. Circumstances tied to the corrupt politicians, and the scoundrels on the Barbery Coast, to the trafficking of young Asian girls. I feel the author did a great job of incorporating the many neighborhoods and their nuances.  I've already recommended this story to many of my friends and I recommend it to you as well.",I feel the author did a great job of incorporating the many neighborhoods and their nuances
4463,"This book was so slow and excruciating to read that I only got about half-way through!  It is extremely rare for me not to finish a book, but I just got to the point that I was so frustrated and really didn't care about the story anymore.  I read it with a book club, and the other members also found it very boring and full of irrelevant details.  The author went into extreme details on the meals Julia Child ate, the history and ancestry of everyone she met, there was no focus and direction to the story - in fact, there was no story, just a bunch of details about a life.",and the other members also found it very boring and full of irrelevant details
4464,"This book on the Gokhale methods provides practical advice on how to achieve basic daily activities without pain.  The photos and descriptions have helped me to sit, stand, walk, and lay down such that my spine can naturally decompress. I have continued to work with a physical therapist on strengthening my body, reducing pain but honestly, until I had read the book and taken the Gokhale class, PT was not working.  I am now able to walk and swim again so I am very grateful for this book.",Practical advice on eliminating pain in your daily activities
4465,"A fantastic study of a monster who murdered people the way Hitler did, only more so and with a decided, deeply evil relish. Political issues here are not clarified by the author, the simplistic impressions of others are corrected. It is dense and complicated as it should be. A great book on a Godzilla in uniform. I cannot wait for Vol II.!!",An Excellent study of Stalin. Unbelievably detailed. You will gasp!
4466,"I have read many books about the atrocities of WW2, and this is one of the best. A truly 'must read'. Both inspiring and devastating, extremely well written account of an absolutely horrific period of time. Devastating and inspiring, I sobbed my heart out. Thank you for retelling this beautiful story of strength and courage and the power of love.","A truly amazing book. Both uplifting and heartbreaking, a must read."
4467,"The art work is stunning but hard for a new Tarot reader, at least me, to interpret. The Rider-Waite decks are the best for learning, but the art and gold foil is beautiful. I do not like the size of the mini-deck, weird shape. I will get the standard size down the road because the art is so nice looking.","Great art, hard to interpret for beginners, mini card size is funcky"
4468,"Here, in the words of the author, the main character, A.J., comments on his own book.

4469,"Silly premise for a story. The nurse has more balls then the Surgeon, who is always measuring his PTSD rating. The villain in the story always works alone but suddenly when it is convenient for the plot he takes on two helpers-reply silly. Why do the bad guys always wait to kill the hostage till the 'hero' gets there. Silly. Villain lets himself get nailed, another silly move by the author.",Spoiler alert-Last Surgeon - this may be the last book of his I read. Silly book.
4470,"Anyone who wonders what our Coast Guard does should read this book.  These incredible rescues are made in Alaska under

4471,"I have read many historical fiction books from WW2 about the Nazis and have amazed at the human spirit. This book is not fiction, but the true accounts of precious Jewish people caught up in the atrocities of this regime.  I felt their pain, their dreams dashed to pieces as they struggled to survive, though too many of them paid the ultimate price.  I highly recommend this book though not to the faint of heart!",The persecution of Jews  in Nazi Germany in WW2 reveals the will to survive.
4472,"I was first attracted to this book because it was the one in a long list of suggested reads that didn't have a woman on it that looked like a prostitute. So I thought, maybe there's a plot! Loved it. Good read, doesn't lag and covers all the basics of what I like (twists, confidence, perseverance, self discovery) I just bought the second one and expect to enjoy it. Three cheers to an author that relies on the story to sell his book.. not the cover ""art"".",... that didn't have a woman on it that looked like a prostitute
4473,"This book is an absorbing page turner.  Although a work of fiction, it brings to the fore the atrocities of human trafficking and enslavement.

4474,"I received an arc for an honest review.

It took sometime for me to get into the story.

Initially it seemed Lily had strong backbone but she seemed to lose it through the story line. She just went with what anyone told her to do. Not something I really enjoy. Personal taste so not knocking the author. It was a pleasant read.",Not something I really enjoy. Personal taste so not knocking the author
4475,"I could not put this book down. This is a classic and it should be read more often.  I only read this because I wanted to do a study of Godwin's daughter, Mary Shelley.  I was surprised at how involved I got in this.  I also read a couple of things by Mary's mother, Mary Woolstonecraft and found those overwritten and overly opinionated with an extreme hatred for men.  This is also very opinionated, but prison reform and human liberty are championed here and the book is much more readable.
This Penguin edition has excellent notes and intro.",Exciting.  A classic which is not grenerally read as much as it should .
4476,"Hey kid! Wannsta learns how to does it right, huh? I gotta friend see, hez names is Nolan Ryan! He'z the greatest pitcher in Baseball!  PLAY BALL!!! Thanks Ump!

No doubt about it, Nolan Ryan had no equal when he pitched baseball.","Nolan Ryan. I watched his play, his no hitters (7), and how he made it into the ""Hall of Fame"""
4477,"Excellent synthesis of John of the Cross and Teresa of Avila. I found the explanation of the levels of prayer to be particularly helpful. I found the explanation of how to advance in prayer and holiness to be particularly challenging--we must detach ourselves from the things of this world and regularly engage in discursive meditation; eventually, God will call us to higher levels of prayer.

This is a book to read and re-read. More importantly, it is a book that urges us to become saints and gives us the wisdom to begin. The day to begin a life of regular prayer is today.",We are all called to a deep interior life of prayer. Begin today!
4478,"Dry, dry, dry... not something I would buy for my own enjoyment, but I needed it for school.  With that said... it does have great insights into the proper methods of researching source documents and how to evaluate their worth.  So all in all, as a historian, this book is extremely valuable.  However, it falls into the pitfall that I think discourages most people from history... it is dry.","Dry, but extremely useful for historians and researchers just starting out!"
4479,"Ravitch is an inspirational woman, and I've met her! This book is great if you're looking for proof of why the business model doesn't work in schools and lots of examples of mistakes we have made in America's education system. I definitely enjoyed it. However, some of it is repetitive and it reads a little dry. I'd recommend further her new book, Rein of Error. It'll shine a whole new light on what you think you know about education.",This is an interesting (relitively) recent history of education
4480,"I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to others; however, the overuse of the word 'core' drove me absolutely crazy!  When I think of how the writer intended to use the word 'core,' it basically means the most powerful feeling one could ever imagine!  She uses this deeply intense word or phrase so many times that it totally lost its meaning.  I say this in a helpful way and not to sound mean or ugly.  I would research other synonyms for this word so that when the reader does come across it, it truly stands out as how intense the writer intends.","I enjoyed the book, but the overuse of the word 'core' drove me crazy!"
4481,"I love reading about the lives of famous people, and Kirk and Anne certainly didn't disappoint.  Their love story and experiences in Hollywood were fascinating reading and I had a hard time putting it down.  Not only do I admire Kirk Douglas for his outstanding work in films, this book reveals what caring philanthropists they are.  I loved it!","HOW GENEROUS OF KIRK DOUGLAS AND HIS WIFE, ANNE, TO SHARE THEIR BEAUTIFUL LOVE STORY"
4482,"A setting of post Civil War sets us up for a sweet story between the strong yet lovely Rosemary and the doctor she begins to work for, Elijah. I love how unique and intelligent Rosemary is- a definite match for her employer....perhaps! Of course, a twist or two comes about, changing the plans for Rosemary and Elijah, adding a bit of discomfort and the unknown. Prayers, thoughts, and verses rest on trust and forgiveness to infuse the storyline with the grace of God. A truly tender hearted story with excitement and gentle nudging toward The Lord!",A story which gives us a taste of God's faithfulness and healing through trials!
4483,"Lucidly written and clear, although necessarily challenging at times, I would love to see this as required reading for first-year university students (it won't happen). The author examines the historical substrate for the current philosophical notions that there is no reality, that truth doesn't exist (equivalently, is ""relative""), and, by extension, principles don't exist, beginning with Athens at its prime and going forward in the History of the Western cultures.

If you have internalized the notions of Kant and his followers, this will not be very accessible to you.",A great read dealing with a critically important topic in todays nihilistic West.
4484,"I have read this book before and it is one of my favorites. It originally was written in a different language (Russian) and was translated to English, but somehow on the e-book version there was no proof reading done because the shear number of misspellings almost made me quit reading it. I wish someone had done a better job with the proof reading/ editing because it almost ruined the book. I cannot fathom someone trying to read this book for the first time.","Get the hardcopy, the E-version was poorly edited and the number of misspellings will ruin it for first time readers"
4485,Again this book continues to explore the people and lives involved with the detective agency and the mechanics shop. It is very comforting to read the tales of everyday life in the core of this series. This one ended with me wanting to start the next book in the series. The chair was delivered and the traditionally built detective has been tempted to drop her diet.  Again the book is such fun to read. Easy to get to know each character and want the storyline to go on forever.,Shoes have a purpose and people have a mission to accept the good things  given them to share.
4486,"Not Anne Rice's best characters, they did not inspire my loyalty.  I could not envision the bestial love scenes without feeling a bit ill-- maybe I lack imagination.  I speak as a person who owns most of the Witching Hour series and maybe all of the Vampire Chronicles.  I loved the narrative book of Christ the Lord-- it was amazing.

The more I read this book the more pulled in I was.  There is mystery, suspense, desire, love and a lot of laughter.  I found myself laughing out loud so many times.  This tiny woman bringing 4 Army Rangers to heel.  Got to love that.  Granted the Army Rangers are all Alpha, but have the utmost respect for Hayley.

It's over and a lot wondering left hanging in the end!  So, I thought, maybe a sequence?  I come and check it out and find that there is none!

This book delves deep enough into the various aspects of Hedge Funds to be very instructive but not too analytical.

4499,"This is one of the best written and edited indie science fiction novels available for Kindle. However, there is never any emotional comnection formed with any single one of the characters, which makes every single person in the book feel a bit one-dimensional.

AD Marrow combines the hotness and badass that is the Kill Devil Motorcycle Club with the fierceness of demon hunters in this PNR meets The Horseman style book.  With a few twists and turns and at least one ""I sooo did not see that coming"" event, the book delivers a packed punch.  A one sitting read and you may need a few tissues.

You could easily change the names of the locations in this book to villages / towns during any of a hundred different points in Earth's history and miss nothing in the translation. In fact, wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that Babylon's Ashes was inspired by an eighth grade history book.

4529,"Only recently have I come to appreciate speculative fiction. This novel is a good one to try if you are uncertain about reading in that genre.  The story should appeal to readers who enjoy adventure, strong female protagonists, and imaginative settings.

Every Christian should read this book through very slowly in addition to regular bible study.",A good read for any Christain struggling with issues of self worth

However, half way through the book starts to get a bit out there and, some might say, ridiculous.  It never gets off the rails but it wobbles.

While there is mystery and adventure (of sorts) here, I read this series for the brilliant, wisecracking Patterson lawyer, Andy Carpenter, whose observations on gambling and pizza, for example, are always spot on.

She would begin a paragraph with a sentence that had nothing to do with the rest of the paragraph and it left me wondering if she would get back to it but it would just hang there. Other times she would allude to something and then never make it clear which conclusion to come to. I wish it had been written in a more interesting manner with a better flow to it.

Harper Lee was returning home for a visit from New York City.  Having the perspective of a ""liberal Northerner"" lent a great slant to the story.  It also looks @ the changing relationship between Scout and her father.  Not everyone in  my book club liked it.

For about half the book, nothing good really happens, yet it is still interested and kept me wanting to read it some more. But the last 1/3, the story picks up.

This book skewers alot of the upper level Navy politics, and the protagonist runs around narrowly escaping trouble many times. It tells it up front, and really, it captures alot of the 90's Navy. Pretty fast and fun read. It's a huge and very sad surprise Jeff died at his home last winter.

I would love more like this from an author who has proven she is more than capable of taking on the challenge of a new style of writing and created a brilliantly funny book.",Brilliantly funny book with lovely characters you wish you knew personally

It is a recipe book, so you don't have to think about the client - just choose a diagnosis and copy the pages for that.  the problem is that every plan has over fifty items.  If I read through, or worse - copy out all the items on one list - it takes more time and energy than to actually think about what I ought to do for the client.  I would rather think it through.

I love that the sleuth is a smart woman, who is respected and denigrated at the same time by the local police.  Set in the 1920's in England, it could have been darker, but  enjoyed the lighter feel that the book exuded.  The characters were fleshed out clearly and well, and were totally believable.  I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series!",Excited to find out that the next book in the series is already available!
4600,"This book looks at various aspects of expeditions and exploration and illustrates them with real-life experiences of famous (and not so famous) characters.

4601,"This book started out with such promise. It was witty and made me laugh out loud several times in the first chapters.  The writing is quite good.  Unfortunately, the story went on way too long.  It could have been shortened by about 100 pages.  All the characters were unlikable and very flawed.  The only reason I finished the book was because I had to for my book club.  At the end I was glad it was over and I realized that I hadn't learned a darn thing.  A waste of time in my opinion.","If you don't care about learning anything new by reading, this is the book for you."
4602,"Really impressive rendition, a story rich with tension, creeps, terribly wounded people navigating a modern world underlaid with darkness, terror, quiet horror, monstrous behavior. But the story is gracefully told, full of vivid detail, very suspenseful, and the kind of story that has you constantly guessing ahead, trying to divine what on earth is going on. It's very satisfying that way...surprisingly so. By far the best mystery I've read in years.",terribly wounded people navigating a modern world underlaid with darkness
4603,"Great book! It clarifies the different values that are the foundation of Christianity and Islam. It makes it clear that Christianity comes from Natural Human Behavior and Islam comes from power-hungry  humans who use it to enslave people into their violent, misogynistic, and predatory belief system.

It made me appreciate Christianity even more. It doesn't go into religious doctrine as much as it explores the values that each belief system promotes and punishes.","Explores the values, not the doctrines, of Islam vs. Christianity"

4608,"I purchased this for my grandchildren hoping it would help explain how their uncle became their aunt.  However, I will not read it to them, as there is lot about a very young boy wearing girls' clothing.  I think that is not uncommon when a little boy has an older sister whom he admires.  I would not want them to think that any time a boy does something like that, or plays with dolls, it is a sign he is/will become transgender.  Very young children don't understand what toys or clothes are for boys and what are for girls.

I have experienced a few of these myself, and reading the book helped me to have a greater understanding of these interedimensional events. I have had the priviledge of interviewing Phil on the radio, and his wisdom and ability to tell his story is just as apparant in his book as it is on the air.

4610,Liked this book very much. It took a different slant compared to other books about people's stories during the war. Of course it was a love story first but This time the setting was in Italy.

Lots of times there is nobody to run to for help and I can't afford to always go in and pay for ""tutoring"" on knitting issues at my local yarn shop.  This fills in that gap for me.

Williams does not seek to persuade the reader about the LDS church one way or another. He just tells it how it was. Some things were terrible, some were great, some were just learning experiences.

This particular volume contained 3 issues of a Fantastic Four story, and 3 issues of an Iron Man story (both set in the ""House of M"" alternate reality).

It was so compelling and it just seemed that these two were made for each other I had no choice but continue reading it.  Nick and Harper had so many scars inside and out, and yet they looked beyond what they saw and loved each other for them.  Even when they had people trying to tear them apart, they continued to push that all aside and fight for their love.  I will continue to read more of Emma's books.

4621,"What I most appreciated about Jon's style of writing is that he doesn't hold back from diving into the nuts-and-bolts of HOW to do the things he talks about.  Too many books out there are little more than a glorified cheerleader, rah-rah, just think positive and it'll happen types of tomes.  By contrast, Jonathan walks thru step by step, even giving multiple recommendations for what software can best be used for accomplishing the task at hand.

I think I might have enjoyed this more if it had been in one locale, rather than globe trotting.  The romance with Soledad didn't grab me.  Sorry to say this was one I did not finish.

It is designed to be used from front to back though parents could cherry pick some lessons according to their child's needs.

She is very genuine with the thoughts and feelings of the characters.  It was a very fast read, making you want more after it is completed.  She takes her characters on a journey and makes you fall in love with the characters.  The characters each have flaws, but it is satisfying seeing them develop and work through these flaws.  I highly recommend this book, and am now looking forward to reading the 2nd novel in this series.  Enjoy!",She takes her characters on a journey and makes you fall in love with the characters
4634,"There are no impractically sassy women fighting vampires here. There is no karate or steely resolve that allows a human to beat up creatures that are supposed to be as strong as tigers. There is simply very wry, very smart, very observant urban fantasy. The characters are well drawn and the world of the book doesn't start to live alongside the world you're used to; it continues to exist within it.

I really enjoyed this, and I'm a very fussy reader of sci-fi,and fantasy. But then I grew up near where a lot of it takes place, so maybe I'm biased. I don't think so.","Fantastic urban fantasy, without any sparkly vampires or goofy stereotypes"
4635,"I didn't go past the second chapter. This is expository writing at its worst (went in the room, opened the closet, saw the clothes) no interesting turns of phrase and since it costs nothing, I gather it's one of these ebook editions that charge nothing in order to attract enough readers who will spend a few dollars on the next installment of the series. I really don't get the positive reviews. I wouldn't recommend this book if you intend to get something more out of a book than just read words.",This is worth as much as it cost me...zero! One star for correct grammar.

The politics and resulting devastation to Guademala is heart breaking but this volume very well written with interesting presented in 3 historical time periods.  At the finale, the loops are tied together in a satisfying conclusion, considering the subject matter.",Worth reading for historical perspective on issues we still are facing.
4637,"Alan Beechey's books featuring Oliver Swithin are stellar! Funny, incisive, well-written, well-plotted, with a little sweet romance, and...did I mention funny? As in Laugh. Out. Loud. The interrupted funeral scene had me ROTFL.

You don't absolutely have to start with the first book in the series, but they are all so delightful that I recommend it. Also, if you like Beechey, try the books by Ruth Dudley Edwards. (Can be hard to find, but worth it.)","Please, Alan, don't make us wait so long for the next Swithin mystery"

I also enjoyed how this book got straight to it. No mucking around. It hit the ground running, and didn't let up. It was as smart and clever as Spike Lee's Inside Man but with more heart.

4642,"All the other high-end presentation books I own focus on the 10 largest (meaning audience size) presentations a person is likely to give. This book focuses on all the other, smaller, conference-room presentations (in comparison to ballroom-style presentations) we give. His advice was great, and has really shiftedd my design thinking. As a plus all of his advice comes from social science research on how to persuade and educate people, so his techniques are likely to be more then just the latest fad",Great discussion of everyday presentations you are likely to give at work.
4643,"I listened to the audio version of this book narrated by Paula Cale (Joanie on the show ""Providence"").  All of this novel is good from start to finish. The author explores relationships both good and bad: parents, siblings, partners, extended family, friends...and the dynamics of life's emotions including depression, love, hope, and happiness.

4645,"The Way of Kings is Incredible! Such a great book! I started the book with high hopes and finished it completely satisfied. The only concern you should have, would be the beginning. The way he forms the world he creates and the characters he presents are slightly boring at first. So the first 100-200 pages are just slightly boring. But after that, it just keeps getting more intense and riveting. Way to go Brandon for getting 2011 book of the year!","Incredible book. Yes it does start slow, but then intensity increases"
4646,"I've just started reading this book and am unbelievably annoyed. The first page (or maybe more?) is missing from the beginning of each chapter.  So I am missing part of the story.

While I thought the vivid descriptions of the working conditions of the medical staff were outstanding, I found the romantic stories stretched my willingness to believe a little too far.

That is the last line in the description, and very accurate for this book. I was pleasantly surprised by this dystopian ya romance. The concept the author used to world build a land of magic and secrets, was brilliant.
I've read my share of the popular category of ya dystopian. This was one of those books that stands out. I liked that the characters were flawed, good, bad, and mostly, redeemable.

So much that the usual denial tactics of the Monster Control Bureau don't really work...which causes problems of its own.  The one problem with this book is that it's clearly a setup for the next book, with a bunch of loose ends left hanging.","An entertaining read, but definitely the second book of a series."

Seth was a great character and I really like Garrett and can't wait to see what his story will be later.  The only thing I hate is having to wait till Sep for the next part.  I know the wait will be worth it though.  This was a great beginning to the series and can't wait for more.  Jodi has pulled me in with this one as she did with her Broken series.

4699,"""Everything I Never Told You"" is a well-written cautionary tale.  A reminder that our children are not our ""do-overs"".

The story revolves around the Lee family and the disappearance of their favorite child, Lydia.  The characters are well-developed--they sort of jump off the page.  The parents are selfish and self-centered.  Despite some of the hardships they faced, I felt neither sympathy for nor empathy with them; they were each so self-absorbed.  The children are heartbreaking.  I wanted to rescue them.

This book had more than one author so couldn't one at least give it a week to edit? That is why I am only giving it 2 stars.",So many stories have great potential yet if I have to stop reading
4723,"Even if you are not an observant person, you should read this book. I came to realize how important shabbat can be, not only as a spirital moment, but also as an art of living, as an aesthetics of life. This book is interesting to read even if you are not an orthodox Jew (it speaks to every Jew), and even if you are not a Jew. It is a very enriching window on a specific mindset and culture.",This made me understand why Shabbat is so important to so many Jews
4724,"Some of the chapters are more interesting than others, but the narrator's personal reflection parts are boring and too detailed. Get Bringing Up Bebe instead. The writing is better and the family more engaging. I was hoping for another like it when I bought this. You do get a greater variety of parenting quirks, but it's nowhere near as enjoyable.","More diverse parenting stories, but not as well written or enjoyable as Bringing Up Bebe"
4725,"Loved this book! When it first arrived, I sat down with time to read just one chapter, and ended up reading three. Great historical details--some of which I hadn't known--about an important time in the history of the Mormon people. It's also an entertaining story about a young boy growing up as he overcomes obstacles. I teared up a bit as I read the epilogue. It's worth the read!","Wonderful, Heartwarming Story with Interesting Historical Details"
4726,"The story takes shape in a strange old bookstore from the point of view of the new clerk, who quickly realizes there's more going on than what's apparent on the surface. The underlying mystery and the intersection of technology in their search provides for a refreshingly different, and wholly entertaining, read that will fly by.",An entertaining juxtaposition of literature and technology in a uniquely fun read
4727,"I read the short prequel (Crime Scene) and the whole book (not some preview that ended in the middle of the story) and found this series interesting though I knew the killer long before the the killer was revealed.  I have also read the rest in the series and this may be the best along with the prequel.  There is plenty of violence and graphic descriptions, so don't choose this series if that bothers you, but there is also interesting procedure and good characters.",I have also read the rest in the series and this may be the best along with the prequel

4729,"Actually this is an excellent summary of our religions extant today.  There is no criticism, but rather a straight forward presentation which settles the curiosity that the reader may have about all the different takes on worship.  The book follows a chronological growth with the Middle Eastern religions.  Then goes back thousands of years in the Indian subcontinent.  Would recommend !

This is a scholarly and intelligent work which deserves inclusion in any number of disciplines.",Don't be put off by the title.  This work is very worthwhile.
4730,"Once again, Dr. Glenn has authored a meticulously crafted genealogy that is lively reading. As he traces the Washington line from the sixth century to its appearance in America, he illuminates a significant strand of European history. Each vignette of a king, an earl, or a baron - all ancestors of the Washingtons - is both history and drama. The result is a fascinating narrative that will both inform and delight: especially those who are descendants. I highly recommend Volume 3 to any student of history, or any descendant of the Washingtons.",A meticulously crafted genealogy that is both history and drama.
4731,"This is the anti-Whig book. It challenges all the current platitudes about how people got it all wrong in the Middle Ages, and then came fortunately the reformation, and the enlightenment, and everything has always been getting better since.
Instead, it traces current problems of ideology to their roots in thinking mistakes of the Middle Ages, mostly Ockham's nominalism, along with some of Duns Scotus' thought. It follows the trail of errors methodically from thinker to thinker, leaving no icon of progressivism unblemished.
It is dense, but quite doable for the average armchair intellectual.","If you can only read one book that defies the dominant narrative, this is it!"
4732,"Reading this book gave me great insight into the thinking of Muslims, their families, and their lifestiles, and therefore a better understanding of the crisis involved when one becomes a Christian. Learned a lot I didn't know.  Well written, pretty fast paced.  I was never tempted to skip over pages although it is a detailed account of the conversations and thought processes of Nabeel and his friends.  A good read indeed.",Reading this book gave me great insight into the thinking of Muslims
4733,"At first this appears to be a really cool and accessible book about brain science.  But as you read it it becomes apparent that this is a self-help book dressed up as science.  It's page after page of miracle cure, how people with no hope for their terrible brain injuries were helped effortlessly and permanently by modern training techniques.  Which, we seem to be able to find only in this book, rather than out in the real world.

As in most self-help books, it's fun for a while then easily forgotten.","Self help books are like bubble gum, really good at the moment but leaving no lasting benefit."
4734,"I have been on a journey of inner self-improvement for a while now, but realized that in all the work I'm doing in the present, there were still a lot of things from my past that I may not have dealt with fully or at all. This book delves deep into early stages, looking at the story we've convinced ourselves of as reality v. what may be the actual reality--in essence, perception is reality. Though it's brought up some painful things, I believe it's a necessary step for having a more authentic future.","Awakening what's deep inside through writing, thought, and reflection"

I went on to read all six books in the series this past week, they go quickly. I won't tell you what the books are about...enough of that elsewhere, I will tell you I am not sorry one bit to have spent my hard earned money for for this series.

Only regret is that I am always disappointed when I read ""The End"" the adventure came to an end all too fast.",if you know any lil ol ladies you will laugh...and then wonder about them
4737,"Oliver Potzsch has made reading a mystery book fun again. By writing mysteries based somewhat on his ancestors, he takes us back in time to Germany of the Seventeenth Century. His is not a rose colored world, it is unpleasant, nasty, full of superstitions and omens and people fighting as usual for power and wealth. If you are a person on knowledge and wit you might likely be hung or burned at the stake. This is more than just a fun vacation or summer read.","The First on what is now a series of really fine, fun, mysteries"
4738,"This is a great book for those interested in psychology, marketing, advertising or those who just like to have cool stuff to talk about with friends.  In fact there is a whole section on products and ideas having value as social currency.  If you are a fan of radio programs like ""Under the Influence"" on CBC you will enjoy this book.

But keep in mind that this is non-fiction lecture material and, as such, you could find it dry.  I didn't.  I thought the examples the author used to illustrate his ideas kept it accessible.",As compelling as cute cat videos.  And explains why cute cat videos are compelling.

4741,"My wife and I have always enjoyed the writings of Brandilyn Collins; and her latest novel, ""Over the Edge,"" is no exception.  It contains her trademark theme, 'Seatbelt Suspense'... but it is also a serious and courageous effort to inform her readers of the treacherous Lyme disease, and her in-depth analysis and defense of treatments which are apparently still in conflict with many in the medical community.  This important book--suspenseful, shocking, informative, and spiritual--is highly recommended!","Ms. Collins' latest work is suspenseful, courageous, and informative"

4744,"Anya has the capability to write very humorous stories, but she needs to stay away from ridiculous.  Penelope could have been a naive but charming girl, but there were too many cases where she was just infantile.  The hero was much to volatile; one minute he's acting tender and two pages later he hates her again.

This book is so far heads and shoulders above any other art or art history book I have, and I have lots of them. It details the entire history of the period, highlights important artists, including 4 that are ""forgotten geniuses"" and discusses history of the studios that influenced so many of today's artists and animators.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is the history -- how exactly did we start to think that only animal flesh was only source of protein, and that protein was the most important nutrient?

My bubble of her being the wholesome, sweet, young lady on One Day at a Time television show, was popped. The book was interesting, sort of like when you see a horrific car wreck on the highway, and you don't want to look, but you do.

  That said, this book is not so much about connecting as I expected it to be from the title. It is more about some tricks to impress others and avoid uncomfortable situations and graciously helping others to do the same. I would call it the book of social etiquette.",Not a book about connection -more about impressing and avoiding uncomfortable social situations
4795,"The strangest thing --I am now able to actually read and browse through this nice little pastry book. Before I was unable to read it at all.  Because each time I selected to open the book it would open up and then go away instantly. Was able to see it on my iPad and iPhone but not on the Kindle Fire it would rollback to the carousel..

I had thought at first the author must be a woman, the writing is gentle and slow, the main character is a woman who had been imprisioned in a Japanese slave labor camp during the war.  The discriptions of the natural enviornment are rich, and those of THE garden are inspiring.  Enough to make one want to further study the Art of Japanese gardening.  The storyline is incidental but interesting.","An inspiring philosophical read about Japanese gardening, remembering and forgetting"

The other is a mostly pieced project in greens but also includes black (or indigo) silhouettes for a really amazing looking quilt in my opinion.

This book is a solid, clean resource for learning about the TI MSP430 microcontroller. I am impressed with the full coverage of topics that are glossed over in other '430 books. This book bundles together a lot of practical information gleaned from a wide span of TI data sheets and app notes and does so in a way that makes very good sense.

This is pretty much part one of book one, if you want to see any story arc resolution get both books and read them together. With that out of the way, the characters, plot and world are quite good falling on the bit darker side of Urban Fantasy.

4818,"One of the worst books I have ever read.  To compare it to The Girl on The Train insults that book.  She seems to be attempting a Gone Girl sort of story but the twists are artificial, contradict everything we have previously been told and have no basis in any ""clues"" we might have been given.  The protagonist is presented one way for most of the book and then is suddenly very different.  The book reads like a gushy romance novel and I skimmed much of it because it was agony to read.

To read of someone who loves their dog, trusts him, and who would go anywhere with him with their lives basically in each other's hands, brings the companionship that you can get from a K9 to a whole new level.

4916,"Wonderful creative writing.  Full of intrigue, with characters who are capable of keeping it there for sure.  Joan is definitely one scary woman, but loyal to the hilt to the team.  J.C. is commanding and fulfills every attribute as a leader for his team.  One learns to love all the characters and each for individual reasons.  SO worth the read...words cannot cover it.  Unless you are Rex. He can weave a compelling story to the inths degree!",You are reading a very very worth while Author when you read Rex Carpenter.
4917,"I have read both books by Kendra Elliot. Hidden , her first book.
Chilled is her second book. Chilled was a roller coaster of a book. Full of suspense, action and it just drew you into her great ,interesting story that was as a real page turner. I cannot wait for her third book to be released. I would definitely recommend this author to anyone looking for a good book to read!","This book was full of suspense,action,romance!

The action unfolds in a deeply moving way--captivating with a momentum that keeps you reading as your pulled deeper into the story and the context in which it's set. More in the series, since this is book 1. Hard to find a better read for fans of fantasy saga.",Hard to find a better read for fans of a fantasy saga--and this is only book 1!
4919,Fell in love with Nicho and his charismatic way with the ladies.  His larger than life personality and being able to handle anything that was thrown at him made a perfect fit for Maria Acosta.  The heartwarming tale of the Oz and Maria reminded me a lot of Romeo and Juliet given they were supposed to hate each other from the paths their parents created.  Awesome book.,Fell in love with Nicho and his charismatic way with the ladies
4920,"This novel is a fast and easy read. The plot is relatively uncomplicated, romantic overtones, then there is one very exciting event that moves the plot to an 'urgent' reading pace that involves somali pirates invading a boat on the high seas - action packed and suspenseful.
That sequence is essentially the most riveting part of the book. I consider it a really easy evening's read.",This novel is a fast and easy read. The plot is relatively uncomplicated
4921,"This novel departs from the usual formula for our favourite Bankok half-Thai detective. Jam-packed with philosophy and science-fiction there is precious space left for the usual wry look at the antics of the Colonel, nor are there descriptions of the ridiculous behaviour of Western tourists and residents of the Land of Smiles.
I felt it too densely focussed on the single story, entertaining though it is. This time the setting cvould have been any major city and the unique nature of Thailand was missing.",This novel departs from the usual formula for our favourite Bankok half-Thai detective
4922,Book number 6 has a murder right at the beginning but the focus is on personal matters as Harriet is coming home.  New relatives appear on the scene and major secrets are revealed.  I read the first six in short order and wish I had started a month from now so Book 7 was in my hands right now.  The suspense is killing me already on what comes next for Flavia.  Best one yet but so many more questions than those that were answered.,Best one yet but so many more questions than those that were answered.
4923,"I started reading BV Larson with The Undying Mercenaries, and his Star Force series did not disappoint! He is a great author, his books are action packed and addicting.

I have thoroughly enjoyed all of his work that I have read and I can't wait to devour more!",and his Star Force series did not disappoint! He is a great author
4924,A interesting look at Nazi Germany and its rise to power through the eyes of an American reporter in Geemany before we entered the war. The reader gains insight into the people themselves in Germany and some of their feelings about what was happening. The authors thought on it all are clearly expressed in his diary. A fascinating read for those interested in WWII. Hard to put down at times.,Nazi rise to power through the eyes of an American correspondant.
4925,"Buy this book in hardcopy. It is excellent! Read the other reviews.

However, the Kindle edition is full or errors. Every word ending in ""a"", with an accent on the ""i"" is missing the ""a"" that should follow. All opening exclamation marks, i.e. the ""upside down"" exclamation marks () in Spanish are lower case letter ""i"" in the Kindle edition.","Excellent book, but plagued with errors in the Kindle edition"
4926,"This is an almost ""gripping"" story of how the British and Americans overcame what started out as Germany's superiority at the start of WW2 through strategic, tactical and technical improvements on the sea (the battle of the Atlantic to finally ensure safe passage for convoys is described in detail), in the air, and on land.  This should be a ""must"" for anyone interested in how WW2 was won.","Fascinating ""behind the scene"" insights of how the Allies achieved WW2 Victory"
4927,"Don't waste your time with this if you're already married & having problems. My husband & I both read it and he ended up using it as ammunition in fights with me. This would have maybe been useful BEFORE the wedding. Before the ring or dress were purchased.
So if you're dating & seriously considering proposing - read this. If you don't mesh well with your ""languages"" and still decide to get married you're in for years of hurt & therapy & hell. There are other books that are more helpful for when you've already crossed & burned the marriage bridge.",Don't waste you're time if you're already married. Just don't.
4928,"Salter is a wonderful  writer in his deeply felt observations of people and places.  He writes elliptically so that things are not always set out  in clear logical order--like poetry.  Doesn't do for the reader to  try to pin down sequence of events, places, etc.  Best to go with the flow.  Atmospheric....  I felt the sex was great to read about, but was more a man's fantasy of having his way with a perfect, beautiful, always ready, sensual 18 year old than an exploration of the complexity of feelings involved in adult sexuality.","France in the winter And lots of carefully, thoughtfully described sex with an ever eager jeune fille"
4929,"This book definitely feels like a programmer to programmer book to learn about Javascript (and what are its good parts and why). It is very concise which is nice, but because of this if you are new to programming you might get frustrated.

I personally think that it is also beneficial to have been exposed to functional programming and object oriented programming (like C# etc.) to get the most out of it.",Good book for Programmer to Programmer to learn more about Javascript
4930,"I liked Towles first novel very much and this one even more. At the beginning, I worried that he was taking the Russian Revolution too lightly but by the end, he did a great job of showing its impact on the Russian people. At the same time, his humor and ability to make the reader care deeply about the characters kept the novel from being sad. In fact, it's a lovely novel. I downloaded it on Kindle. After reading it, I bought a hardback copy so that I could read it again, getting the full impact of chapter titles, etc., I highly recommend this novel.",Wonderful character development and ability to show Russian Revolution impact without being preachy
4931,"This is a challenging book because you are never certain whether you can believe what any of the characters and saying or doing -- people in a mental hospital are the ultimate unreliable narrators.

Because of this, I really struggled with this book and ended up skipping most of it to see what happened at the end.  But just because I didn't care for it, doesn't mean it is a bad book.","I didn't care for it but if you can deal with the unreliable narrator, you might like it."
4932,"A truly fitting end to an epic tale.  We bid a bittersweet farewell to good friends that we have traveled with through 9 books.  Eric has brought us on a journey of great joy and great sadness, where close friends become family, and you can't help but to feel as they feel, and mourn when they mourn.  In the end, Eric has brought this wonderful tale to a close in a way that does justice to the series, and will leave any true dedicated DH fan satisfied.",We bid a bittersweet farewell to good friends that we have traveled with through 9 books
4933,"Just had an opportunity to listen to Skip Prichard speak about his book The Book of Mistakes.  One of the mistakes that resonates so much with me mistake number two - Why do we allow someone else to determine our value.  Its so true why do we listen to other peoples labels they give us. We shouldn't let negative labels stick on us, we can hold them for far too long in our life.  A temporary set back is but a temporary step backwards for the next step forward.  A must have in your library.",Great job in sharing what not to do - and so much humor in the story - The Book of Mistakes
4934,"I thourghly enjoyed watching the growth of a young man, from the trenches of the WW I to teaching history in a private boys school, his personal life and it's trials and tribulations.  He has grown into a sensitive father and headmaster as the bombs begin falling on Britian and the WWII is in full force.

A skillfully written book, that draws you in before you know it.",an excellent review of the period between the first and second world wars as told by a brillant sensitive man.
4935,"Kallmaker did not disappoint!! This story was well worth the wait! I liked that we saw these characters over time, and saw their struggles. I loved the way Jennifer evolved. It was sad that she had to deny her personal life to have the life she dreamed of in Hollywood. I will definitely put this one on the list to read again.",Kallmaker did not disappoint!! This story was well worth the wait
4936,"Though somewhat dated (1958 imprint) this book can still be useful as a solid general introduction to the theories of special and general relativity, as well as the concept of curved space. I would just recommend that  after reading the book, readers also avail themselves of Hermann Bondi's 'Relativity and Common Sense' which explores key areas (primarily of the special theory) that Russell pays only passing attention to.",Somewhat Dated - But Still Valuable As An Introcution To Einstei's Theories
4937,"I absolutely loved the locale of this book! Of course, duh, it would be Austin. HA!!

This book kept me mesmerized for hours and I loved it!!!! So many suspected characters for me that, of course, did not work quite that way. Ahhh, the joy of a good book!!!!

I do have to say that Caitlin did tend to get on my nerves a little with her self analysis and issues. However, I still enjoyed the book. A lot!!!

4939,"Basically a great message about how there is nothing wrong with you.  Thing is that the superego prevents people from being free and Cheri's message helps us to get out of that mess.  This is about the best simplest book on dealing with the superego, or at least getting to know the voice of conditioning.  Soul without Shame is not as good as this but I will say it teaches how to address the superego by telling it to eff off.  There is nothing wrong with you should be helpful to all people who want to grow spiritually.  Helps overcome one of the most common basic blocks to freedom.","If you think there is something wrong with you, ever, then read this!"
4940,very precise in describing the events that took place while still maintaining an impartial view of the case. Will recommend to all who are fond of such unique murder cases. The way the murder was committed it appears that the murderer was quite skilled medically and aware of how to remove all traces. And the circumstances as well as the expertise was only possible with such a man. A very hard case for the prosecution.,A very accurately described account of a truly unique murder case

4942,"I wondered if I would enjoy reading a book about people making a dictionary. I was pleasantly surprised as the book explored relationships both work and personal besides just educating me on what goes into creating a dictionary .This book also made me think much more about the words we use in our daily, the varied definitions within each word.  It makes me appreciate the work it takes to write a dictionary. This review is pretty boring but the book held my interest and kept pushing me toward the end.",I wondered if I would enjoy reading a book about people making a dictionary
4943,"This book had me distraught the whole time reading it. At points, I understood the story and at other times, I was lost.
But throughout the whole journey, I couldn't put down the book and see what the story would reveal to me.

Sedgwick's writing is so beautiful and haunting in this story. It really gave the book a really intense, creepy vibe. As the book continued on and on, I kept feeling more confused and unsettled. The book counts down to one main event and it wrapped up the whole book perfectly. I'm so glad I read it.",Sedgwick's writing is so beautiful and haunting in this story
4944,"Although not my favorite by Ral Laplaine, (mainly because I have loved reading his more lengthy books and this one is shorter), I enjoyed this bold and fresh view, using a futuristic sci-fi approach to solving the very real existential problems of todays world.

4946,I got these for my friends 2 year old. They really aren't made for someone so little. The dolls have to be cut out and a grown up or much older child should do that. The paper is also thin so the dolls could be fragile. BUT frankly I expected that so I laminated them and put sticker magnets on the back. She'll be able to play with these on a cookie sheet. So now she has cute paper dollies and the clothes will stick on the girls and their dogs.,REALLY CUTE but might need a little modification if you are buying for anyone under 7.
4947,"I used to teach French, and I can't recommend this book enough. This is what French kids use in school.

It will give you a real advantage in studying.",Necessary companion to French text books for the serious student
4948,"This was a decent read, though little of it was unique. Most of the advice is pretty standard, and like most books about marketing, some of the advice is good, some of it bad. That being said, it's free, and it's worth picking up if you're interested in marketing a book. It provides a solid foundation, though it is a little out of date (which the author fully acknowledges in the preface, and that's why it's free).

All in all, not bad. Pretty average, so worth looking into.","Most of the advice is pretty standard, and like most books about marketing"
4949,"I love the Replacements, but didn't expect this to be as much of a page-turner as it was.  Knowing the band's history didn't ruin Mehr's narrative for me, mostly because he keeps the focus on the 'Mats and their band of co-conspirators.  Yes, I sort of wanted a broader picture of the 80s indie music scene in general, but that's been done to death elsewhere and this book is stronger for leaving some of that out.","Focused and sharp book about a batch of unfocused, messy geniuses"
4950,Bernard Cornwell has the ability to take his readers back in time to periods and situations that we could hardly imagine. He builds his characters into historical eras and breathes life into events that would otherwise be forgotten. The archers of England may be a forgotten commodity in modern times but they were a fearsome weapon in the early fifteenth century. Cornwell may be criticised by those demanding absolute accuracy in military detail but he writes a compelling and entertaining yarn as he describes the events leading up to the Battle of Agincourt.,The best way to enjoy learning about history is to read Bernard Cornwell.
4951,"Fabulous and well-written book on Kali and her true identity as the Great Goddess. I enjoyed the author's explanations of the Indian tradditions from firsthand experience.

Also a good read for anyone hoping to get closer to the Goddess by working with Kali.",For Those Wanting to Work with the Great Goddess Through Kali

I commend the author for an outstanding job.","A very fine book, that makes us grateful to live in today's world."
4955,Terrific historical novel that's also a great mystery  (no spoilers!).  Taylor has created an atmospheric plot driven book with an underlay of realism.  Marwood is carefully crafted and very complex.  I loved that some of the supporting characters are real people such as Wren.  I found myself checking other resources to expand my knowledge.

There is a lot of great information here on the real nuts and bolts of running a home business - especially an artistic one - but I think anyone who wants to run thier own business could use a lot of the information and tools in this book to manage their time, money, and goals in an effective way.

As my writing does not generally involve my own personal experiences as such, this is proving invaluable to me.

The Pom to Sara to Pamela to Kamala roller coaster starts to become unbelievable towards the end, as the author doesn't spend as much time with the hero's transformation from colonialist to open hearted husband, but I got the message of how power inequalities distort relationships.",An enjoyable trip to pre Independence India with a daring heroine

In some instances he is a great story teller and has active interesting characters such as the captain.  In other instances I thought he wrote this for his youngest daughter and her favorite pet.  Without throwing out spoilers I think the author would have been better off using a fictional animal instead of a house pet.",Kind of torn between like/dislike.  Will wait for second book to decide.
4984,"An irresistible, loving an creative retelling of Cinderella. Its one of my favorite Bridgerton books , cause I love so much the hero AND the heroine! I wish they were part of my family! The scenes between them are a delight to read, Id read this books again 100 times! A delicious and lovely story! I Have to say how much I love this cover, gorgeous!",A retelling of Cinderella..Much BETTER than the original Cinderella!
4985,"I thought I was getting a ""new"" paperback.  The spine has the vertical creases that come only from the book being opened repeatedly (as in, when someone is reading it).  The edges of the pages that are exposed are discolored; yellow/brownish.  The first few inside pages are letting loose from the binding.  I won't bother to return a paperback, but I thought it was listed as ""new"" and it surely didn't LOOK like a new paperback. If I misread the description, then my fault.  But overall, not a great experience.","but I thought it was listed as ""new"" and it surely didn't LOOK like a new paperback"
4986,"This book could have easily gotten 5 stars, but due to to the poor editing this is my first time rating a book as such a low rating....I'm not even leaving a review on the book because there is no way an editor or writer should have allowed such poor publishing...I'm sure there had to be the red line under ALL these misspelled words and green lines for these grammar errors with missing words...I just don't see how it's possible...heck I'll offer to be your proofreader if that helps this is very bad for business...about to read part 2 in hopes it's better.",Could have been great but the editing was just a traffic accident!
4987,"One of the best books on relationship dynamics and mature relationships. David Richo is a brilliant therapist and a compassionate, heartful human being. If you ever have the pleasure of seeing him in person, take it. he is a gem on the planet earth. His intelligent writing weaves heartful thought with practical strategies for co-creating relationships of respect and deep love. We have bought several copies and given them to many friends. All have felt the material to be useful, understandable, and inspiring. May we all come to one another from our clearest and most loving selves!",Wonderful book for anyone in relationship (that means everyone)
4988,"It is great that Bush will not extend the privilege he was born with and enjoyed his whole life to keeping the royalties from this book, but donate them all to Veterans of his wars and survivors of the fatalities, most of whom have enjoyed no advantage in life and could well use some help, not least in recognition for their service and sacrifice.","Wonderful that he will not profit from this book, but donate proceeds to Veterans"
4989,"Waited for this installment anxiously after reading Book 2.  Couldn't put it down until it was completed.  Was in withdrawal and need my fix.  Satisfied for now until I need my next fix.

The story is fantastic and continues where book 2 left off.  I loved the characters that have saved the day and will have to do it again tomorrow.  Can't wait for book 4.  Thanks for the series!",Addicting story line continues.. You won't want to put it down!
4990,"The plot moves along at a good pace and ends with an explosive climax. The danger is unremitting, and the suffering is heart-rending. Great bioscience details, without being boring or overwhelming. This reads like a detective story, as the characters follow clever clues and use cool technologies. On the weak side, the narrative is lacking in character development and interesting dialog. Worst of all is the writing style, which often devolves into short choppy sentences. Where was the editor????","A real thriller, but not much in the way of characters or writing style"
4991,"The author uses many characters to give the reader glimpses into the Civil War and the marking of the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg.  After reading it I found myself going online to read actual reports as I found the occasion so interesting.  The story is based on facts, story told by fictional characters.  Another good read.","An inside look at Gettysburg, the Battle and the 50th anniversary activities."
4992,"I had an opportunity to review this book before it came out and found the parallels between the Biblical feasts and the fulfillment of them in Christ Jesus absolutely fascinating! I appreciate the fact, too, that Pastor Krebs and Mrs. Schact addressed subject matter from a Biblical point of view rather than what's often popular with the modern church of our day. This book is refreshing and will take you back to the foundations of our faith in clear and concise way.",The Parallels Between The Biblical Feasts and The Fulfillment of Them in Christ Jesus is Absolutely Fascinating

4997,"I strongly endorse this amazing book! The songs from JJ Schulzs distant cockpit come from his heart and show the passion and intellect of fighter jocks that are often buried in the macho ethic showed to the outside world.
 This is not just another I did this book; it is a  reflection of the core values of the officer corps that supported the missions assigned by our leaders with dedication and elan , and oblivious to the  risk of life and limb. Read and savor this tome of personal and song-filled reflection.

4998,"This item was used - I knew that - but it was said to be ""used-very good"".  I would disagree with the assessment because the spine is heavily worn, the cover is heavily worn and there are markings in red pencil and regular pencil throughout the book.  In addition, there were quite a few scraps of paper in the book and an automobile decal as if the book had never even been looked at for evaluation.  I had used the ""Italian Made Simple"" book years earlier, and this is why I wanted the ""Spanish Made Simple"" book of the series.

I found I could not put it down though because overall I was entertained.  That's my reason for giving it 4 stars.  But it's also just so sad. Overall I'd describe it as an exaggerated tale of a very dysfunctional family, with all their quirkiness.",This book has some really funny moments. It's pretty graphic in its sex scenes

This book was a freebie but if I could buy books I would have paid for it.

The plot is a bit far fetched, but keeps the central character real.  She does not become the sudden detective whiz, but rather remains the friendly woman next door who acts as one would expect--contacts the police when appropriate and keeps friends advised about discoveries and comes away with justice for her friend.

5005,"Yancey approaches questions of theodicy from God's point of view. This is a bold task, but he does it excellently and convincingly without seeming to overstep the human ability to know God's thoughts and feelings. I highly recommend this book for anyone who struggles with being disappointed with God. It is also a great introduction to viewing the story of Scripture through the lens of God's desperate love for humanity. If you've ever found yourself reading Scripture and thinking ""this God doesn't seem all that loving,"" then this book is for you.",Great book! Yancey makes a bold attempt and does so excellently
5006,"This book has a very unique and interesting narrative style from the first pages: a sort of breaking of the fourth wall that adds to the whimsical and (if you'll pardon the pun) sweet feel of the story. It borders on fantastical in parts but not in any way that would detract from the story that's being told; if anything, it adds further dimensions that you could never have seen coming.

5008,"An excellent fantasy novel.  I've paid twice as much for books that aren't half as good.  The standard tropes are here.  Magic, knights, dragons, etc.  Pretty standard coming of age story, but this novel does an excellent job with it.  You actually care about the characters and their struggles are significant, without making the entire world hinge on one messiah character.

Easily one of the best fantasy novels I've read in some time.",An excellent coming of age fantasy novel with far more weight than your typical kindle purchase
5009,"Bulgakov seems to have lived a relatively privileged life and resented intellectuals materially rewarded more than him, his satire is mainly of them, it is not Swiftian nor against the crimes against the ordinary population.

5010,I am a student of History and am always fascinated by accounts of men who know how to solve problems.  In this case the problem was the communist insurgency in IndoChina.  These men applied tactics hard learned on the battlefield of WW2 and they applied them rather well against the guerrilla fighters; and that lesson was make your enemy fear you even more by using his own tactics against him.,Excellent historical account of how to fight a guerrilla war.
5011,This was an adorable story that wrapped me up in its enchanting tell.  It moved along at a great clip that i was easily able to read it all in one day which is a rare feat for me.  I like that this was a novel that is a book two in a series but can stand all on its own.  I was a bit shocked by some of the violence but in a good way cause i was not expecting it i like an author who can shock me and make me no way she did not just do that.

5012,This was my gateway drug to all things Mariana Zapata and I'm officially a huge fan and have added her entire book list to my TBR's. Slow burn with a HUGE combustible ending between the two.

Simply written.......would appeal to high school or Middle school boys...as wall as adults....these ships were very similar to a school, with good guys, bad guys, hero's and bullies, cliques, friends and jerks.

I enjoyed the story but was not prepared for it to end as soon as it did.  There is a bonus book on my download and looking at the percent left in the book was misleading to me.  I really thought the plot was going to twist or something.  But nope.  Ended before the 50% mark.  Still a good story with sizzling sexy times.",Totally hot 'triad' story where the author just jumps right into it
5015,Difficult book to like because the characters aren't nice to one another but the book itself is extremely well done.  I have read all her books and I'm not sure that it isn't her best effort.  It is much more realistic than some of the others.  These are characters who aren't finished and I'd like to see them brought back.  Unusual for her.  Definitely would read it and glad I purchased it.,Surprising thoughout the book and far from an average summer read.
5016,"As someone who recently lost my mother at the way too young age of 65 to the same type of pancreatic cancer, the subject is a difficult read, but one that is also helping me learn more about what she went through.

Judaica Press began doing this for the Chumash (text of the Torah in book form).  The biggest problem with it is that they didn't finish the job: they never published volumes for Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy.

If you like an anything can happen sort of novel you might like all the book. The Devil is let lose on the unbelievers.  The second half of the novel seemed to just ride on the well structured first half's coattails.  There is a lot of innuendo to Stalinist Communist life and hypocrisy.

5037,This is one of the novels that has a story which reaches down in your soul.  The points of societal growth vs morality is described very well in this novel.  Before picking this book up you should know the book is very much driven by psychological philosophy rather than action packed story line.  It is also translated from Russian making many of the metaphors and saying difficult to understand.  It is also a quarter million words so not really a light quick reading.

I tend to agree with the author as in this situation quite often we don't know what we don't know and therefore experimenting is more efficient way to explore alternatives rather then self search.

Some readers advised starting with something easier like the Wind Up Bird Chronicle.  I am currently 3/4 of the way through this.  It does not bounce back and forth like Kafka on the Shore and Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki did.  I like it a bit less because it is somewhat less complex.

It's a commentary on the war on drugs-but with all sorts of characters-politican, rock star, homeless teen, and the only thing they have in common is drugs.

 - I couldn't feel much for the rich, pampered, haughty central character
 -There is an overload of historical information, like educating the ignorant

5113,"What a great overview of the OT symbols contained in the tabernacle! This is a short, easy read, but is rich explanation and application. Each portion of the tabernacle is taken in turn, including the Sabbath, and explained in OT context as well as NT context, and then good application given.

5114,"Gina LaManna does it again super sized! Lacey & friends are back in another action-packed, laugh filled adventure that keeps the reader entertained from beginning to end. This book just crackles with the most oddball, quirky characters who find themselves in such unbelievable situations. Even Baby Arnold makes a cameo! Then add in the knock-your-socks of love & romance between Lacey & Anthony,  & you have one stellar read!!!

5115,"I'm so glad that this book was a free download, because I sure would have been ticked off if I had paid for this mess!  So many grammar errors, poor choice for some words...etc. etc.  Hopefully the Author will pull it back and re-vamp with a good proof reader.  I am deleting this from my cloud as soon as I post this review.  I will look into other books by the Author, hopefully they will be a lot better!","Too bad, the writing is poor and the use of some words is off."

Brown really has a way of breaking down the game in an easy-to-understand manner that clearly illustrates what's going on in the more complex aspects of the game.

But if you are willing to overlook these inconveniences, then it is a great addition to your library especially when you are need and want of fine poetry.",The poems are great as always from a great artist like Emily Dickinson.
5118,"Nice overview of a terrific painter.  Not enough of his New Mexico canvases and pretty much none of his sketches, but otherwise it's a very good survey with reproductions that are pretty true to life (of what I've seen in person, anyway).

5120,"Considering Mr. Sabato's normal insights during the political season(s), I had hoped for more of that kind of insight, and less recitation of the various conspiracy theories surrounding Kennedy's assassination.  It's a tedious distraction, at best.  And while I had thought that the treatment of how each succeeding president was affected by the Kennedy legacy, the execution was disappointing.",Not as political as I had hoped...and far too much recantation of the assassination conspiracy theories
5121,I read through most of the lower reviews and I can say that after reading this book I don't believe they read the same book as I did.

5122,Dutton once again demonstrates his grasp on the craft of writing and his versatility as a storyteller. While I'm not usually a big fan of books involving politics (especially this year!)

5123,D.J. Molles has written a satisfying zombie novel and I like it on that basis.  In addition he has written a magnificent selection  on courage and cowardliness that rises to the level of some of the great pieces ever written in literature.

5127,"I really enjoyed the first book.  Although the story was out there, the characters were good and the plot really kept you interested.  I don't recommend the rest of the series, though.  In all honesty, I was so disappointed with the later books, I wish I hadn't read this one at all.  To never really find out what happens, annoys the heck out of me.  Can't recommend this book at all.","Don't start this one, if you would like a satisfying ending to the series!"

5130,"Not my usual thing, but it came garlanded with praise, and generally lived up to it.  Imagine a rom-com that occasionally veers into deeper waters, and you should get the picture.  There are a few good lines, but generally the humour is in the mood, and in the interactions of the characters.  There's a lot of research which is deftly worn.  The squirrel is a neat touch, and the never-ending problem of tying up the loose ends is imaginatively addressed.  It may not, in the end, add up to much more than a row of beans, but beans are good for you.",More than a rom-com but perhaps too bonhomous to hit all its targets
5131,"This is one of the books that was eventually used to make the movie ""Flight of Dragons.""  It's definatly not a staight move to the movie either.

5135,"For the first fourth of the book, I thought I had accidentally gotten a book meant for teenagers -- the language was simple and the main characters were all children. Then the book turned super creepy and violent and included cuss words, so I was pretty sure that it wasn't meant for children. It was a little weird not knowing who the intended audience was until well into the book.  If it was for children, then it was too creepy and violent. If it was for adults, then parts of it were too simplistic.

I'm an engineer, so I love reading about the work and the technology.  But I'm also a student of people, so I love reading about the people, the personalities, the politics, etc.

5180,"Love my thrillers & definitely hoped on UK crime thrillers. This is a little more closely matched in the use of their language, but definitely easy to understand. Most importantly you have to understand the rights of a suspect or of anyone being interviewed in the UK, so unlike here in the US. Maybe that's what I like the best, they are fair & still catch the bad guy.
The story pulls you right in, at times you wonder if they will catch him. So many twists & turns. No excuse for not giving this a read if you like thrillers.","Excellent, a little different than the normal UK crime thrillers"

5184,"I really enjoy this series, and this book was no exception.  If you're looking for a completely wild ride of a mystery with a ton of plot lines and characters, this is your book :)  I personally found it all a bit overwhelming and would have preferred it to be a bit more simple.  I also missed hearing about Goldie cooking (another character did most of the cooking in this book), as it wasn't as vivid as when she normally describes everything that she's preparing.  Still loved the characters and the overall writing.","Too many characters and plot lines, but I still love the series"
5185,I'm an appreciator of cards as a way to work with the mind. The Children's Spirit Animal Cards are a lovely deck. Each one has a beautiful painting of the animal and a simple phrase. The combination of the two things is surprisingly powerful. You don't have to be a child to use these cards. You can carry them with you easily and they'll inspire moments of closeness among you and the people you meet.,Each one has a beautiful painting of the animal and a simple phrase
5186,"This is the only book that I know that has explained the 12 gemstones of the Bible and their significance, whether on the breastplate of the High Priest or the foundations of the wall around Heaven or in Revelation.

It will add to your own knowledge even if you have already read numerous other books on the Soviet experience.  The author has produced a book of true enduring value on the history of WWII.

5195,"I like the first-person diary-entry style.  I wish I had known the paperback was not Trade Paperback but instead more compact Mass Market Paperback. Tightly bound with single-spaced text.  Have reordered in hardcover version.
Now that I've read it, it was a bit dry and tedious to get through -- sooo much information.

5200,"Good, detailed world building with interesting and flawed characters.  There are genuine shades of grey and conflicted motivations on every front.  I appreciate the fact that these books don't wallow in violence while still moving the plot along briskly.  The writing is slightly shaky at times but not so much that you'd notice.

5201,"C S Lewis is a deep thinking, introspective, and logical writer. He doesn't preach to the reader, but rather guides the reader through the matter of Christianity in a way that helps the reader to better understand God's work in man and man's need for God.

Unfortunately, too much of the book takes place in present times, in my opinion.  I would have preferred much more of the historical fiction part of the story.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the premise is better than the execution.

5219,This is an entertaining series and this book carries it on well. The story in this book (of what's killing people) is a bit predictable. Other parts of the story (like that she is introducing all these innovations because she had the idea and the details are minor when the reality of innovation is always the opposite) are quite weak. However I still like the story because the characters feel well developed and the interactions feel real.,A good series. There are flaws and this book isn't the strongest of the series but worth reading IMO.

If nothing else, this an amazing story.  The writing is a tad clunky now and again, that may  relate to to subject matter, but it relates to a sector of history that I don't know a lot about, while thinking of myself as a WWII semi-freak.

Learning of the development of the LDS faith through Joseph and his followers is clearly explained and w/out prejudice.  The information regarding FLDS families enables one to understand the evolution of plural marriages, [which are deplorable --- my personal opinion].

5241,"I'm a small business owner and this book really resonated with me. Serving God and building a business can create a lot of conflicts. It is clear the Author knows his stuff. He gives a great framework for dealing with the pressures in integrating your faith into how you run and grow a business.

The author, writes in a personal and practical way that is very powerful. It is obviously that he uses the principles he outlines daily.

Excellent book for any business owner.",A Practical Book That is  Perfect for Any Small Business Owner.
5242,"A clear, very well organized explanation of key linear algebra concepts. Many worked examples. Like most math books, requires several readings of critical sections to fully understand and appreciate. There are still a few places where concepts were put to work before they were fully explained, and that caused me to give this book 4 instead of 5 stars.","A clear, very well organized explanation of key linear algebra concepts."
5243,"This second book in the Intuition series carries forward with bang, suspense and a nasty baddie. The main characters work together as they follow the culprit out of their jurisdiction in Minnesota to the Canadian city of Winnipeg. Quirky pets, a touch of the paranormal and old friends add to the charm of this book. The story is fast paced, the criminal element portrayed in chilling detail and the ending explosive. An engaging read. Check it out.",Intuition - does it help or hinder when you are in search of a criminal?
5244,"Unique. A story that is brand new. I read way too much. So reading a book with characters that are not billionaires and a dumb, inexperienced girls in it, was refreshing. At first, I really did not like Moses all that much. He was not one of those guys you swoon after. However that captured my interest. It was a well thought out story that actually had a great ending. Not a thrown together ending that makes you say ""Really?!"".
I am happy someone recommended it to me.","So reading a book with characters that are not billionaires and a dumb, inexperienced girls in it"
5245,"This is a rather long novel, one that took me time to really get into, especially for the chapters i found uninteresting and unnecessary, specifically, the chapters that don't include the brothers, and focus on other subplot characters, i loathed reading the chapters about the priest, in my opinion, wasted too much time on that, though i do understand the underlining reasons for it, being the religious undertones in this book. Overall, i enjoyed what i read, only wished the book would have ended not so vaguely.","especially for the chapters i found uninteresting and unnecessary, specifically"
5246,"I only purchased this because I received a notification that R.K. Lilley had published something new. Being a dedicated fan I purchased it. I had no idea what this was supposed to be, I still don't fully understand. I think it's a collection of different authors continuing the same story. However, having not read the books before this one, I had no idea what was going on, and quite frankly, didn't particularly care.

5248,"Reads like an historical novel. Her Frida jumps from the pages as she does from her self-portraits, though I see Selma Hyack in my mind's eye. Using Shepard to guide the reader through history with his poetic commentary is genius. I am certain his name is not an accident. But what really strikes me as magical is Ms. Kingsolver's ability to manufacture each voice as unique and distinctive; a true mistress of her craft. The book is long and not for those looking for a potboiler. It is well crafted and a darned good read.","Absorbing and interesting insights into war, politics and Mexico."
5249,"This is a review of the audiobook only. I am a true fan of Dorothea Benton Frank but please....she is not a professional narrator. I was able to reach chapter three before I pulled the plug. I still didn't have any grasp about characters or story line and was becoming increasingly annoyed with the narration. I commute 100 a day and constantly listen to audiobooks but just couldn't continue with this one.

5250,"This is a great, multicultural romance featuring two smart characters who fight hard to make the most of their present and future by refusing to let their traumatic pasts interfere. It took a bit of time to get into it (I didn't feel like it flowed until around the 1/3 mark), but once it picked up, I was entrenched in this smooth and mature love story. I recommend this to readers who love adult romances with characters who deal with (relatively) real life dramas. This one features a heroine I recognize in the mirror, and a hero so dashing Id marry him in an instant.",A notable debut from an author I'm looking forward to more from.
5251,"It has been said so many times, but this is truly a masterpiece of science fiction. This novel has completely exceeded my expectations! I am a newcomer to the genre. One of the fascinating things about this book is how Herbert combined so many aspects of genres outside of what you would expect for science fiction: politics, feuding powerful families, psychology, mysticism, socio-economic issues, and more. This is a complex, intriguing, entertaining read for fans of the genre or fans of literary fiction. I think it crosses over into those two worlds.",A Masterpiece of SciFi that Bridges the Genre and Literary Fiction

5253,"I usually like the author's books with its poor downtrodden but spunky heroines who survive tough situations. However, this one was BAD. I should have never picked it after I read the words: ""familiar stranger"" shows up. Of course, it's Alex! The whole premise about Jo being a possible war widow just went out the window, or should I say, jumped off the gable. I liked the spooky atmosphere, but the device the author often uses, ghosts help save the living, is getting tiresome.

5255,"I didn't really love this book, in the end I just wanted to finish this to find out what was happening. The concept was interesting, and I would have liked to have seen more following the grand reveal. However 75% of the book is about the protagonist, Ethan, getting beaten up to near death multiple times again and again. What kept me from being enthralled in the story telling was how extreme his injuries were after each fight, and yet his miraculous ability to function with pretty minimal side effects. In the end [Spolier] it feels like the protagonist just submits to the bad guys. :/...",The author neglected to mention the protagonist has super healing abilities or something.

5259,"I found this book interesting to read as it showed the power of collaboration and open source software. Yes, some may argue that there is nothing new within this book but the underlying lessons that I took from this book were:
1. To explore further how collaborative technologies could be optimised and used more effectively.
2. Continue to evaluate and keep an overview of the open source movement and software development, in general.","Collaborate, research new technologies and evaluate 'software' wars"
5260,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

What did I like? It was a very compelling book. I got sucked into this book and ignored the world for a while. The heroine was a strong, courageous woman. I was impressed with her ability to survive and move on.

What did I not like? This book had a lot of hard subjects: stalking/abuse, lack of police competency, and even the idea that people with money and influence can get away with things that they shouldn't. The way the system in the story worked, or rather didn't, was a bit disturbing.",This was such an awesome read. I look forward to more for this series-

Butler's role in exposing the attempted 1933 fascist coup plot against FDR has been erased from our history books because the conspirators, JP Morgan, Dupont, Rockefeller, Harriman et al are too powerful.

Annalise's journey of self-discovery is at times heart-breaking yet very uplifting. From the subdued and down-trodden at the outset; her metamorphosis is complete and powerful. She becomes an example of what strength one can find in self. Her husband Aaron, while detestable, is a very real character. His flaws drive the story in ways that I didn't expect.

I told him, that as a tax payer, I think they should shut their big yappers and either do their job proudly or leave and let a better and more loyal American do the job.

Ms. Fletcher interviewed over 100 teens for the book, and I loved the myth-busting that came out of that - even I, as a Registered Dietitian with nearly two decades of experience found some new insights and great nuggests that I'll use when counseling other young people. What a wise group Ms. Fletcher found, and she interviewed them well.

Highly Recommend.",A fun and fascinating read for teens and the parents who love them

As to accuracy:  I probably would not follow his directions for heating the jars in the oven and would use the USDA canning recommendations.

You will find recipes for making scones, strawberry jam and clotted cream.

This book by one of our go-to authors did not disappoint. The Cedar Cove setting was familiar and the story line took an interesting turn with historical significance. The sub-characters kept the story going along and provided a couple bumps along the way to the main character.

After reading this book and taking a course that went along with it I developed a new-found interest in graph theory, which was an area I thought I hated.

5432,Everyone in my study group loved this book but I did not like the writing style. It maybe a generation thing...the ones who loved it were maids I am a mother on my way to crown. I did like the reflection questions at the end of each chapter.  I am passing it on to my daughter whom it may speak to more.,Topics interesting but writing style geared more toward those just beginning their work in the craft
5433,"I have spent a fair amount of time in Cuba and with Cubans over the past decades.  Paduro's main character, Mario Conde, embodies so many of the contradictory, joyful, hopeful and critical faculties that one will find in conversations with folks in Havana and with some in the expat community.  Put this into some well-plotted mystery stories, and you have a series of delightful books.","Fascinating Characters, Well-Drawn Stories, Insights About Modern Cuba"

I remember reading these Marvel 70's collection books in the bookstore for HOURS! The Artwork! The Stories! I am so glad that Amazon has such a diverse used book market to get great periodicals like this. It reprints the origin stories of X-men, Iron Man, Daredevil, Avengers, Silver Surfer, Nick Fury, and the Watcher, all with intros by Stan Lee. Loved it. Cant recommend it enough.",A classic Marvel collection from the 70's that only proves (again) just HOW awesome these tales REALLY are!!
5435,I loved the book because I was blessed to hear the man speak in either 1967 or 1968 at our school chapel service.  I remember this very small wizened man who quoted so much scripture and yet with a warmth he showed his love of God and the Bible.  Wonderful story of a man on a mission and what a blessing it will be to see Brother Keeble in heaven!!,Only bad thing is it didn't include his age and date of his death.  That's part of a Biography!
5436,"I loved this book because it's all about God using ordinary people who love Him to touch and heal others and bring them to Jesus. Aliss has so inspired me to continue contending for the gift of healing and prophecy. Since I started reading her book, I have prayed with several people and God has healed them. PTL!!",Awesome book!  A must read for those who want to hear that God loves us and wants us well.
5437,"Ella James' ""Fractured Love"" is a great read. It's part of a series, but you can read it as a standalone, I did. If you like angst this book is for you. It broke my heart so many times I was nearly hopeless, but Ella managed to fix my fractured heart with her amazing words.

This book depicts the daily activities and workings of a good military working dog. The personal aspect from the handler's view point is spot on. The bond between man and dog is something in this situation is something most people will never know...........read the book and you will have a good idea though.",This book depicts the daily activities and workings of a good military working dog

5440,"I'm assuming now, without going back to look this is fiction.  A beautiful story though.  As a mother, my heart bled for this character.  It kind of reminded me of The Shack, where ultimately the parent finds peace with the death of their child.  I gave it only a 4 because it was a little slow-going with the back and forth...you'll know what I mean if you read it!",I couldn't figure out if this was fiction or non-fiction during the read
5441,"I loved The Nine, and this follow up was just as good.  Jeffrey Toobin provides a thorough and thoughtful analysis of the workings of the Supreme Court, the interactions between the justices, and their respective agendas.  At times it seems like a multi-dimensional game of chess, but he always makes it clear, and understandable.",No one explains the arcane workings of the Supreme Court better than Jeffrey Toobin
5442,The James Bond of Ian Fleming's books have very little in common with the film versions.  These Bonds are thoughtful and a bit somber.  The 00 designation seems to weigh on them and they seem to be tired of the responsibility.  They writing is first-rate and Fleming is a very good storyteller.  Tom Hiddleston does a execellent job narrating.  Highly recommend this audio and will definately purchse more Ian Fleming books.,Great character and storytelling; even if it is a departure from the films
5443,"I have purchased other look and find books in the past and this one was definitely not as good at the others. The other ones are more detailed in the pictures and look better overall.

5444,"At first, I thought this was a science fiction book. It's really a set of stories that seem disconnected so far (I'm half-way through), but are in some ways intertwined. Almost everyone on earth is dead from a virus, and the book covers stories from before as well as after the apocalypse.

The author's style is conversational. Usually, this is nice. On some rare occasions, it's hard to tell, during dialog, who is talking. There are some sentence fragments, but it never prevents me from understanding the meaning. I guess it's written in a way I'm not used to: it's not academic writing.","Writing is enjoyably different, story is about humanity during apocalyptic times"
5445,"Was anxiously awaiting this next chapter in the lives of Kaylob, Beth Ann, and Blake.  I was not disappointed.  More than just a beautiful love story.

5446,"Written with stark detail this story of the underbelly of meat processing is eye opening.  Even our Commissario Brunetti is shocked by the cruelty of this place of death, the smell and the individuals who work there.  It made me think long and hard about becoming a vegetarian following the footsteps of Brunetti's daughter.  However, our hero, once again finds good people trying to do good things as well, as bad people doing VERY bad things.  The description of informing the victim's wife was particularly touching.  Seeing her grief of things left unsaid and undone was heart breaking.",once again finds good people trying to do good things as well

5449,"I have no doubt that the ""green blob"" hates this book, and I'm positive Dr Mann does. But it would do the environmental movement and the politicians/aides who pass laws to ""stop climate change"" to read this book and check the references. The book details very clearly why Dr Mann is a poor, thin-skinned scientist and his hockey stick bad science. There is no doubt that Mark Steyn is picking and choosing but the sheer number of scientists who criticize Mann is impressive and this book does a great service in gathering together many of the various criticisms.",Should be required reading for policy wonks and environmentalists

Enjoy!",Great! for those who enjoyed The Secret Garden & those too young for Harry Potter
5453,"This book series, of which I have read the first two, has an original plot and clever twists and turns.  I don't think, however, that the series rises to the level of some other series in the same genre.  The second book in the series, Descent, suffered from a number of grammatical flaws.  I do not recall seeing them in this book but it's been a while since I read it.  I recommend the series as a clever and enjoyable take on an apocalyptic event.",Good series.  Looking forward to the third book coming in Spring.

I wasn't glued to the book but I did read it all in one day.  Writing is pretty reasonable, characters are likeable - he - honourable and attractive (also secretive with burdens).She - every woman with a touch of irish goofball.

How was the only variable and the variations went all over the place.","Meh, I liked the characters but this story took a long time to get anywhere"
5496,"Another page-turner from Liane Moriarty. I didn't want it to end, and then ordered another book by this author as soon as it did.  This is a poignant story of the realities of adult life- specifically the challenges of maintaining a happy marriage with kids- and a rare look at what happens when all the ""junk"" is forgotten, no matter the cause.  As someone who's been down the road of divorce, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. This book makes you realize than many a marriage might be spared by a ""harmless"" bump on the noggin once in a while.","Another great tale from Liane! More wives and husbands should ""forget""!"
5497,"I especially enjoyed reading how the aristocratic and academic people in Germany lived in the pre WW 1 and WW 2 era. A very gracious and traditional moral atmosphere seemed to prevail.  Dietrich Bonhoeffer was an amazing, accomplished person I would have enjoyed knowing.  I was totally in awe of him.  Parts of the book were rather tedious (unless you're a history buff), and it took me quite a while to complete the book.  On the whole, very worthwhile.  Glad I persevered. .","Bonhoeffer, a wonderful example of great character and accomplishment."
5498,"This book takes the ordinary wonder would-be travelers might find around the world and brings it home - then helps us see it at home, too. It is as much about learning how to look as it is about specific things we might want to look at. Perfect for children wanting a non-white main character to follow!

5499,"The right horseman, the right horse, and the karma for them to meet at the right time.  This is a fun read.  One of the most thought provoking thoughts in the book comes when the author points out that if you were to see a couple of really talented show jumping horses turned out with some ordinary  mounts, it's not possible to tell which horses are the talented jumpers or the usual hacks just by looking at them.  Actually, this champion had marks on his shoulders and neck from the heavy collar used while pulling a plow.",Snowman; the Journey From Plowhorse to Madison Square Garden and Showjumping Championship Fame

Hostetler did the footwork, picking out pertinent lines from the bards plays, explaining the context, then pointing out thought-provoking parallels in the Biblewhich Shakespeare often quoted! This book is a cool gift for anyone who loves and reads Gods Word. (Note: like most devotionals, the readings are divided into a page a day. But I found myself reading several pages at a time.

I was captivated by this devastating, heart-wrenching account of a girl whose freedom is violently torn from her when she leaves England to live with her father's Muslim family in Iraq.

From the time Martins family was introduced and Summer invited to their home for dinner, the book went downhill for me. I found the characters and some of the dialogue not suited to a contemporary setting and thus, rahter unbelievable.

5512,"This is the second book in a row from VeloPress that followed this formula:take an unknown author with a good book and get a B-level pro rider to put their name on it and write little anecdotes that may or may not be useful.

In this case, it's a good book on racing tactics with stories from Chris Horner about how he whined until he got his way in a team time trial and held onto a car to get up a mountain in a race.

If you've read Thomas Prehn's book on the same topic, there is little new here, but it's still a decent book on how to race smarter in road racing and crits.",Good book on racing tactics with little to do with the big pro name

The other 'mistakes' discussed are really just taste preferences. Old standard songs have various melodies, as they are passed through the generations. There are a few places where I prefer a different chord, but the given chord is not necessarily wrong.

After several occasions when he called friends names based off of bathroom humor, we decided that the books were being a bad influence on him. Second, the author has chosen to depict Harold in a homosexual relationship. As a Christian, I find this to be morally intolerable. It is wrong to influence a child into thinking that a perverted lifestyle is normal or healthy.","As a Christian, I cannot allow my son to read these books anymore."

I would definitely read the next one to come along about him.","Great PI story, good characters, will read more from this author."
5517,"Absolutely terrific writing marred by a plot that goes from annoying to absurd. About two thirds of the way through, the level of stupidity of the main character drowned my ability to keep reading. The book is full of many wonderful sentences, but the characters were so unpleasant to be around that the writing couldn't make up for it.

John once again has to make some very difficult decisions which allows the readers to analysis their life and decision if they had been placed into that same situation.",Awesome continuation of a great story....makes you definatly think..

5521,"In general it is a good guide.  Because it focuses only on one country, there is a lot of information.  I don't like the maps at all.  The red letters on pink background make reading very difficult.  Also, there is plenty of space on the maps so that for any given landmark or building or structure, written information could have been included easily below or beside the spot.  Rather, the writers just put a number on the landmark and refer the reader to the back of the page to see what the number means.  I expected better.",In general it is a good guide.

That image of a woman who is semi-feral, cavorts with women, finds a hapless man to have a baby with, then leaves the baby with him to raise -- kind of an Odysseus Ulysses story.

By then I was hooked into book 2, which quite honestly I didn't really understand the Name towards the end of the book - maybe the third book could have been called this.

Unfortunately, the book doesn't do a particularly crafty job of synthesizing the events and circumstances that moved metal over 30+ years. Rather it takes on a fairly amateurish chronology more than a historical synthesis. With the heavy handed treatment of Metallica, and a minimum of insight, it is a work that ultimately leaves you wanting more.

5561,This is the best novel I've read this year.  It tells about love and hate.  It speaks to sexuality in a way Kinsey numbers just cannot.  Travis' wife died 4 years ago and left him with 3 children and a crippling hole in his life.  He meets the town's new veterinarian  Travis.  Travis is out and flamboyantly proud (or at least he tries to be)... Travis has returned to the small town where his grandparents lived and he had so many happy memories.  This story telling is great because it subtly tells of these men's struggles and the people around them.,This is the best novel I've read this year.  It tells about love and hate.

I still like Lestat, her 1985 book the most, but I have read and loved most of her book's, including the Mayfair Witches. I liked this book because it brought so many characters together and explained the beginning of the Talamaska. I look forward to her next book as Prince Lestat doesn't have a conclusion, the ending is a beginning, or a set-up for another book. It was an enjoyable read, continuing the Vampire Chronicle's.","Finally, The return of Lestat after over a decade of waiting!"

I read all the Joe Pickett novels, and have enjoyed every one.

I enjoyed this book more than any of Box' others.",A terrific author spins a fascinating story about the human story of greed.

Great stories (some humorous) and a great storyteller -- he made me feel the action and inaction, too.  It's not a book about the Spanish-American War, but a book by a soldier during that war and his experiences.  Anything but boring.

I really liked that the book, while advancing the overall storyline and setting up the 2nd series arc, let us catch up with all of the characters and relationships that we know and love.  It's not often that the reader is given that gift.  I also enjoyed that Nalini brought this 1st series full-circle, with Lucas, Sasha, and Naya being the main focus.

There were great disagreements and discussions during the formation of the government, the makeup of Congress, the financial stabilization to name just a few. The most interesting part to me was discovering that John  Adams wanted a government headed by a type of royal figure, and Jefferson and Franklin  were pretty cavalier about what was happening. The two most serious and dedicated people were Washington and Hamilton.","Alexander Hamilton, the genius in the formation of the United States"

But just like Clash of Kings this book is a filler for events and characters who are being moved into play for the sixth instalment of the series.

If not for the lectures of my professors that go along with it I'd not be able to grasp this on my own, which is what they are for I suppose. But trying to use the definitions in the back make it more confusing than you would have been already. Those are useless, to me anyway.

But Postman offers an intelligent (if dated) critique about the real epistemology of our media and how we often fail to interrogate the ways in which different mediums privilege certain methods of thinking over others. His observations about Orwell and Huxley are, I think, spot on. Postman doesn't provide any real solutions to the problem of T.V., he's just concerned with diagnosis.

5667,"I'm not usually a spy/thriller reader of books--I like to laugh.  But this story was engaging and interesting and not a moment of boredom.  Full of suspense, too.  The only problem I had with the story was that as the story dealt with Arab characters/names, I kept a tablet by my side to keep a list of the characters and how they connect to the story, straight in my mind.

Paul Deaver is one of the best new authors I am following.

Beyond Eternity Is a hard book to describe. While there are political dystopian aspects to the story, that is only part of what makes it work. In some ways, the book is about the hero dealing with trauma and moving on with his life. To some extent, it is a coming of age story. In many ways, I would describe it as being a non preachy, The Sleeper Awakes, by H. G. Wells.

5691,"This book was a good second volume in a story that has many chapters left. I really liked the character development of Faith, the go-to-hell teen fighter, and the interplay between those had foresight to think about dark alternatives and those who expect to be treated like they were before catastrophe.

In this book I noticed that parts of the story seemed episodic, with a new problem and the good guys figuring out a novel way to overcome it. But it has a great premise, great characters, and an inspirational climax that leaves me waiting anxiously for the third volume.",Great continuation of an interesting take on the end of civilization

A white southerner can not help but feel ashamed of some of their neighbors who might have participated in such outrages against the Afro Americans in Florida and other areas. Their are times the book is very repitious, but overall it is very enlightning. It shows both the strengthes and weaknesses of Thurgood Marshall.

Elliot Kay writes how good romantic fiction books should.

5704,"These Chronicles of the Kings are some of the best historical fiction I have read.  They are true to the Biblical account and also historical records; well-written and riveting.  An excellent read from start to finish!  I learned that King Manasseh, whom the Bible says was one of the most evil kings in all of Judah's history, came to repentance after being imprisoned by the brutal Assyrians.  He came back to God and confessed his sins.  (I also found this in 2 Chronicles!, where Lynn Austin credits her information.)

5706,"Mostly, when you see the phrase ""fun for all"" it really means ""fun for nobody"", but that does not apply here.
The Foglios' illustrations and writing are vivid & joyous, and their sense of humor displays minds born with the belief that ""the world is mad, so why not enjoy it?""

Clever riffs on the old Universal Horror classics mix with wild sight gags & a great fondness for the spectacular in their work.

The notes  and word studies are comprehensive and help to shed light on difficult passages of the New Testament and give an historical perspective to many sections. Scott Hahn and his collaborators are to be commended on this publication. It is well worth the price. The purchase has prompted me to read the New Testament from cover to cover which I haven't done in years.,A must read for any Catholic and any Christian for that matter.

The book covers how they met, how they became a comedy team and what drove them on their separate ways, but yet, neither seemed to want to be apart from the other.  I discovered things about the pair I'd never heard, both good and bad and Lewis doesn't seem to cover anything up.

5723,"Having read the entire Jack Reacher series, this series sounded interesting.  Even though Jack himself doesn't appear, the writing style is very much the same and the plot is as complicated and convoluted as the Reacher books.  The two main characters searching for Reacher are complex and interesting in and of themselves, but it takes a bit of time to get to know them.

But there were interesting twists and turns that made this story somewhat unpredictable (at least to me).  The editing was nearly perfect too, avoiding a problem in many e-books.  The science part of this fiction merely (but very effectively) supports a well concieved and delivered story.  I liked and enjoyed all aspects of this book and I highly recommend it.

5751,"I've always resisted the morning, telling myself that I am a late night person, and that is when my creative energy is at its highest. However this book has made me face the truth  sometimes when I really need it, that creative energy cannot be found and I cause myself needless struggle to get things done. I am finding it easier and easier to wake up excited and energized about everything that I want to do rather than waking up immediately stressed about everything I have to do with few hours to do it all.",This could be the bridge between all of my efforts and shortcomings
5752,"After reading the reviews and being aware of Prof. Bonanno's groundbreaking research and articles, the book was not what I expected.

5753,"Thicker Than Water is a beautifully written thought provoking book. It is unique, passionate, emotionally and socially charged. It makes you think and it makes you feel!

It leaves you a better person than before you read it. I highly recommend reading it!",Thicker Than Water is a beautifully written thought provoking book

This book took me on one heck of an emotional roller coaster ride. Especially after finishing this book I'm left with my heart feeling  like it's ripped  out.

5755,"I found this book full of spiritual and intellectual reasons of why we cannot unite our Christian beliefs with those of other world beliefs without compromising the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Not lacking in scriptural justifications and logical arguments too.

This is an easy read and full of weapons to help us fight the good fight of faith while extending our hand of love to our non-Christian friends.  We can live together without giving in to the watering down of our faith.","Will we join the ""all are really the same beliefs"" bandwagon?  This book tells you why this is not an option."
5756,"Awesome insight into the heart of the father, son and the sweet holy spirit. Their heart had one word to communicate before the foundation of the world. That word was embodied in the son, and on the cross he demonstrated those words to all of humanity. Thanks you father, son and holy spirit. We are forever grateful. God has blessed Dr. Mcvey for this great insight.",Highly recommended. The word that God purposed to speak to all of humanity.
5757,"I was hesitant to read this, thinking the book summary made it sound sad.  Although there is a little sadness, there wasn't very much, and it was my kind of story - action/adventure with romance thrown in.  I did think it took really too long for the main character to finally take action, but when she did, it was great.  The romance between the 2 main characters does a great job of building slowly, adding to the anticipation and suspense in the book.  I can't wait now for the 2nd book!",thinking the book summary made it sound sad. Although there is a little sadness
5758,"This is nonfiction at its best.  Mark Bowden has written a page turner, and this story is told from all sides.  He zooms in to the stories on the ground in and around Hue, and zooms out to get the military and political response from afar.  It's both deeply personal, as you get to know soldiers and civilians caught in a struggle for survival, while always getting context for the strategic circumstances unfolding.

I truly think this is Mark Bowden's finest work.  Highly recommend!",This is nonfiction at its best. Mark Bowden has written a page turner
5759,"As a student of history, especially European history, The Boy Who Wanted Wings was hard to put down from start to finish.

I would recommend this to any 'seeker with an open mind'.",If you REALLY want to know the Truth...this is the book for you!
5761,"This book has changed my life for the better. I also sent a copy to my sister, who has the same genetic tendency to hold on to everything, and she loves it too. Written in an easily-accessed, organized manner, one feels as though the author has stepped into your house (or closet) to help you.

There were some great moments like when he was saving dogs in East St. Louis, and when he was actually talking about dogs.  The parts of the book that I couldn't stand was he was talking about his love life and hookups.  That had NOTHING to do with dogs!!

5767,"I have loved many of CRH's early novels, but this one felt like the same story retold with different characters.  Her novels often have a disadvantaged youth receiving guidance from an older adult, and I think she should consider this plot as played out.  I do like her stories, but think it's time for her to find a new theme.  If you are short on time, read some of her earlier novels, particularly ""Funerals for Horses,"" ""Chasing Windmills,"" and ""Love in the Present Tense.""  They are much better and more unique than her later works and show her skill as a writer/storyteller.","Same theme, different characters.  Her earlier works are better."
5768,"Very trashy. Portrays Ava Gardner in the worst light. The author wanted ""honesty"", but in this case ""honesty is NOT the best policy"".  Would not recommend this book to anyone I know.  Porn wrapped with a bow on it. Things people don't need to know about her personal life or anyone else's. The author did Ava Gardner a terrible disservice.  He badgered and conjoled to get his story, and then the end product makes her out to be horrible in every light.  Very disappointing book.","Portrays Ava Gardner in the worst light.

I liked the characters and their dysfunction. Do we ever like every member of a family? This is the kind of book you need to be in the right frame of mind to get into. Some books take off right away.

5773,"This book is a lot of fun.  I kept a dictionary close so that I could look-up the animals he described.  I might be older, but I didn't find that the foul language is so prevalent that it reduced my enjoyment of the book.  It just reduced the writer's I.Q. by several points.  Which probably explains why he admitted to having an affair with a married woman.  I like reading about young people who aren't afraid of hard work.  I was impressed by Mr. Slater's work ethic in this book and the Australia book which I read earlier.

I am looking forward to reading his middle book.  I think.","Entertaining and Educational--Well, Maybe Not so Educational, but It Is Entertaining"

With all the work the author did to get us to that point, I was hoping for more with the final character interacting with Detective Rizolli. (I am trying not to spoil anything).

She left a few stones unturned in the storyline but overall I would still reread this book.  Which coming from me is a good thing.  Most get read once and I move along.  This goes in the keep pile for future reading.","Fast paced, wasn't enthralled with the ending after the buildup"

The locality settings are correct for the time period of the book's setting.  Dams, lakes, Branson commercialism have all changed the landscape of the area.

It is a graphic novel and with that stigma comes a younger generation, but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who wasn't mature

Funding does matter, but looking across school systems or states won't reveal how funding is used within school systems or within schools.  The driving factor is teacher salaries, which are generally tied to experience and local housing economics.  Better teachers move to better neighborhoods when those areas offer better salaries.

I thought the characters stayed true to themselves which is something not often encountered in tales of broken people. Yes, lots of sex but for me not particularly sexy.

5816,"Windows into Hell by multiple authors was received direct from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.  Anthologies have been hit and miss in 2016, mostly miss though.  This one has a very interesting premise in: what is there to look forward to after death? especially if you are one of those who doesn't follow the religious straight and narrow path to heaven.  While the stories did not really spook me and of course some were better than others, if you like to peek into windows into hell, this is a good book to do so with.

5883,I started picking out chapters but then I realized I needed to start from the beginning because I keep blocking out the phone and it goes to Voice control because I was holding the keys down too long I need a softer touch but this book Legion through everything in detail and I had to start from the beginning to calm down when the phone did something buti'll get used to it it's been three weeks and I'm just starting to use the park so I learned a lot of little things that the phone does that is absolutely amazing probably too much,Great book for people who need detailed photos and instructions but very simply put I actually could power

Great romantic suspense.",Terrifying and suspenseful - keeps you guessing until the very end!
5885,"Forced to use this text as a part of an MBA program, I found myself pouring over every paragraph without advancing my knowledge. Additionally, the book is riddled with errors, making it even harder to establish any trust between reader and author. If you too are forced to use this text, I hope you are better at finding external resources than was I.  If you are using the text for self-study and have little or no background in accounting, I strongly urge to you to look elsewhere.",Zero would be more precise because of the time wasted on this book
5886,"Even as a male, this inspirational memoir captured me with it's moving story of a woman's journey to find her true calling in life. She threw off the shackles of a suburban lifestyle ordained by her parents' social constrictions and manifested in her husband's perspective of the ""perfect wife"" to discover truths about life, people, and--most importantly--herself, as she visited her ancestral homeland Ireland, learned lessons from school girls in Jamaica, and danced her way into a new, more fulfilling life.","Inspirational, captivating account of a woman's journey to find her true calling"
5887,"Great fun!

Although the main character is a teenager, readers of all ages will enjoy this well-written story.  The boys humor is recognizably that of a teenager, and the rest  the aliens and the authors - is quietly amusing, not forced or affected.  The authors imagination is extensive, detailed, and cohesive; its a rollicking ride in another reality.  The writing flows easily enough, and theres a fine balance of detail (description, characters thoughts, etc.) and action (from the next piece of dialogue to the next plot development.)

Well done!","The authors imagination is extensive, detailed, and cohesive; its a rollicking ride in another reality."
5888,"An oft told tell of a boy out to revenge the death of his parents and sister.  This time with a slight twist - a gun from the future that is ideally crafted for the fast draw.  Even with the time traveling gun twist the story only deserves a one for originality; however, the passion of the writing is in the best of Western tradition and deserves a five.  Averaging, I'd give it a healthy 3,in spite of the fact that the proof reader did a kiss poor job.  Additionally the writer should perfect the proper use of quotation marks - so that conversations are easier to follow.",What would happen if the best modern gun were suddenly in the hands of an 1870's teen age.
5889,"Very boring. The author has a ""holier than thou"" tone to her voice, as though she's far too good to ever use any of these companies. She also never gives a complete answer to whether these companies live up to their public persona or not, just a lot of maybe's. Very annoying and a total waste of time to read. The cover looked interesting, but the content was a ton of filler without any actual, valuable content or even concrete conclusions. This book is a dud, don't waste your time.","Don't waste your time. No valuable content, just a bunch of filler. Author comes off as very pompous. Very boring book."
5890,"This book takes you back to the Civil Rights era with information that you never heard and likely will surprise you.  It brings the focus on our history, some shameful, and some enlightening.  Stanley Levison is one of the behind the scenes people that thankfully gave his all for justice and fairness.  All men have weaknesses that when exposed make one reevaluate the historical halo awarded.  This candid look at the history of the movement, the players, and the struggle to come out of the darkness.  Well done, Ben.",A read that generates reflection and appreciation for those who walk the walk
5891,"This tale is compelling, lifelike, sad, well-researched, vivid -- excellent for any American who likes to read -- and also anyone who is a citizen of India -- because through her fiction writing, the author highlights, describes and analyzes governance and communities so unlike governance and most communities in the United States.",A must read for anyone wishing to better comprehend life in an Indian city of today (the former Bombay until 1995).
5892,"Fascinating! I've gone through this book twice, as well as the companion book The Blue Nile. Moorehead weaves the stories of various explorers over several decades seamlessly. This book is exciting to read and memorizing in the recounting of unbelievable acts of courage, determination, and exploration.","An exciting read of memorizing and unbelievable acts of courage, determination, and exploration."
5893,"So satisfying to get another book full of these hot, sexy Irish (although Will is American) rugby players. And Josey is delightfully awkward, charming, and absolutely wonderful! She's the varlet to his voyeur. They're both kinda clueless when it comes to relationships and they stumble a bit but the story delivers their HEA along with a big dose of steamy passion and charming awkwardness. I loved tbis book.",She's there to rescue him and she does it in her own uniquely charmi ng way

Better to be prepared than to fret over unannounced updates on the job. This is by far the least expensive investment in your future as a Microsoft End User.","Beezix Guides save you time and money, if not your job itself."
5895,"Gwinnett has written a Fast Paced, action-packed , realistic fiction novel the held my attention from the first page to the last. Unlike many initial books in the series, this could be a stand-alone novel . The author wrote a novel with a specific beginning, middle, and end that could continue with another book in the series , but could just as easily concluded with the closing period.","An easy read that is a fast-paced , action-packed, realistic fiction novel."
5896,"I received this book and started reading it, then couldn't put it down. By the time I was done, my sides were aching. Some of the poems are mildly amusing, but some of them are hilarious. All are well-written and capture the personality of a cat. It would be a superb gift for anyone who owns and loves cats.","If laughter is the best medicine, this book is like a super-pill."
5897,"Seraphina's Awakening by Sheena Hutchinson

I wasn't sure about this book before I started it. I've never read an angels versus demon kind of book because I've read any books like this before. But as soon as I started reading it, I was hooked. The book was packed with so much. Angels, demons, mystery, fun and light hearted when needed. The characters were fun and larger then life and the story slowed smoothly. I cant wait to sink my teeth into the other books in this series. This is a great read and I would definitely recommend it.",I've never read an angels versus demon kind of book because I've read any books like this before
5898,"The first several chapters are waste of time in that provide an overview of productivity tools that everybody knows about. Of course, authors point out the disadvantages. Pointless. You learn nothing from that. Sophomoric creation of a straw man. The the rest of the book is pretty contrived to make it appear as if ''The One Thing'' is somehow new and innovative.

But Google ''leveraged tasks,'' and you'll find that what these guys have labeled as the one thing is actually a standard principle which is common sense.",Google ''leveraged tasks'' and you'll seee that this book simply re-packages something that already exists
5899,I've read all three books of the Manchester/Reid biographical trilogy of Winston Churchill and recommend them all.  Fascinating insight into Churchill and the period (1930's - 40) leading up to WW II.  I now have a much deeper appreciation for the roots of WW II and Churchill's battle to raise awareness of the danger of an emerging Hitler and Third Reich.  Manchester was a master writer.  Highly recommended!,Now have a greater appreciation of Churchill role leading up to WW II

5902,"Like any book about personal Near Death Experiences, readers have a right to reserve their opinion about the truth of the account and the subject matter.  Be that as it may, after reading several NDE books throughout the years - and there are a lot of them - this one hit me the hardest.  Especially interesting for me (a closet Prepper) was the account of the destruction that will occur in our time.  It's a moving book - on many levels.  Personal note, the author recently died, but the story-teller lives on.  Don't get the two confused.  It's a really good book.",What is waiting for us on the other side?  Read this book for awareness! You too - Preppers!
5903,"what can i say? i went through a very shojo time in my life. it's girly, it's fun and often romantic. this is a definitive shojo that totally is for boy crazy people. i really enjoyed this series but it went on WAY past 26... that's too much for me, investment cash-wise and the story started to get pretty poor and convoluted. ever seen weeds? like how it's so good and then all this stuff happens needlessly to keep the show going? yeah, that's this manga.

but the first 10 or so are gold. worth a read.","The first 10 or so of this manga are worth a read (girly, fun, improbable!), but after that it lost me."
5904,"Such an awesome idea. Our 10 month old loves to rip out pages from her books and chew on the corners. These books are a perfect solution. She doesn't really spend time reading them so the themes/stories are somewhat irrelevant, but she definitely enjoys chewing/crumpling/trying to rip the pages (without success of course!)",GREAT Solution for babies who love to chew on & rip their books
5905,John Sanford can do no wrong for me.  I know these characters for so many years now they are like old friends.  I love the Virgil books because there is always the main case and a side case which come together perfectly at the end.  My only complaint is that I have read them all and Mr. D=Sanford can't write as fast as i can read.,I know these characters for so many years now they are like old friends
5906,"I ordered this in Kindle version instead of book version because I wanted to start a diet right away.  As a book, it would be a 5 star because I could thumb through and find certain foods' calorie counts ASAP, however, in Kindle version (at least on my older Kindle), finding a certain food group or particular food item was a painfully slow process.  I really wish I had delayed my diet until I could get the printed book in the mail.",Wish I Had Purchased the Printed Version Instead of Kindle Version
5907,"Unlike other contributions to The American Presidents series, especially Burns and Dunn on Washington, the choice of Michael Holt, American History professor at the University of Virginia, was a great choice. In this brief work Holt is able to convey the affable manner, charm, and decency of Pierce who was otherwise a 'Doughface' president whose paramount dedication to Democratic Party unity (and slavish favoritism to the South) ironically contributed to the rendering of national unity and subsequent civil war.",Excellent book by a good historian about a decent man who was a bad president.
5908,"I think this book should be read in every school so that kids in this country would know how fortunate they are. There was some violence and  lots of scenes that were hard to read but I finished with a feeling that I had really learned something. As the mother of three sons, I can't imagine the horror that these poor people suffered at the hands of really evil people. I commend Keeley Hutton for writing this book. It must have been very difficult.",... so that kids in this country would know how fortunate they are
5909,"A captivating and remarkable memoir.  It had me from the first page.  Well-written and very moving.  A story of courage and resilience and how a person's inner life was changed forever at the young age of 17.  What was particularly moving were the friendships that Liz made at the facility with the other less fortunate, teenage, unwed mothers and how they helped each other.  The dynamic between Liz, the person of privilege, and the other girls who were not, was very touching and engaging.  Highly recommended.","What was particularly moving were the friendships that Liz made at the facility with the other less fortunate, teenage"
5910,"It would have been a four or five star if she had done more than very basic research.  There were no bar keepers or women's underpants in the Middle Ages.  The term ""bar keeper"" was an 19th Century word and underpants were a 19th Century item of women's clothing.  She would be a great writer if she just took the time to do her research for the time period.  And yes, I am a history buff.",This would have been a much better book if the writer had done more research on the time period.
5911,"ABC's of Relationship Selling is a great college text that is well written and informative.  It teaches you the best tactics and procedures to find and keep customers for a every long time.

5912,"This book explores the secret of why some people find wealth and others don't. It isn't that they are smarter than us, rather it is all in the habits they have developed. By mimicking their habits, you also can release the power of these same habits. It isn't a coincidence that they all happen to have developed the same set of habits. Rather, there is special power in this specific habits they have cultivated and it is worth your time to read this book and see how they also will help make you rich as well.",Really powerful message revealing how the super rich got there!
5913,"I gave all 4 books a 5. Not much on writing reviews but I would certainly recommend this to any Sci Fi buffs. I liked ther way Mr Wehr handled the military, more like military officers that I was around, That, and he got most of the military jargon right in my opinion. Well done Mr. Wehr I think you made the right/write move.

5914,Great book... can't wait to read book 3!!  This is happening today!!  It is a very accurate look at persecution happening in the eyes of both believers and non-believers.  Both groups have to struggle to survive the same crisis.  One group trusts in their faith while the other group is forced to consider faith outside of themselves.  Excellent perspective on how to prepare and how to deal with situations as they unfold.  Great job Mark!!!,Excellent presentation of two groups living through the same crisis!!
5915,"This character driven sage of religious, political, and social intrigue is set in a highly structured Asian-style world that takes your breath away as you become immersed in it.

I could not be more delightfully accompanied.",Have read the paperback version many times; finding it in Kindle is a delight
5916,"After Mr. McKuen's death I was reminded of all the poetry and music I loved 40 years ago.

5917,"A light, positive romance with some interesting characters and a small town setting.  Ford and Flynn are going to get together and you'll enjoy their journey.  I've always been fascinated with glass blowing so that was an added bonus for me.  I also appreciated that there was no explicit sex.  Nicely written and perfect for a relaxing read.  Thanks to Netgalley for the ARC.",Ford and Flynn are going to get together and you'll enjoy their journey
5918,"The writing is excellent with minimal errors.  The character development is wonderfully complex and surprising.  Despite the numerous new vocabulary words to describe creatures and magical elements, the story is engaging and engrossing.  The fight scenes are vivid without being too horribly graphic.  There is mystery, romantic tangles, magical confrontations, death, heroics, and good vs evil/not-so-evil vs evil-insanity themes that compel the reader to find out what will happen next.  Highly recommend to adult fantasy readers who enjoy multi-layered characters and world-systems.",A entirely new world with very dynamic characters and conflicts
5919,I'm not very tech savvy so I read this to help me understand SEO and how it works.  I'm still needing more info but this was a great start.  I liked the humor here and there because it made the material easier for me to get through.  It wasn't the typical How To manual so I thought it was a very interesting read.,Great for people like me who know little to nothing about this subject
5920,"The author's juice recipes are simple and easy to follow.  I bought this book several years ago and I still use the sushi roll, the juice recipes and the dressing recipes frequently.  Also, don't go out and buy a mandolin or a vegetable spaghetti spiral slicer, I did when I bought this book and never used them.  A good ol' knife will work just as well.","Great for the experienced vegan, but recipes are unfamiliar and not that appealing to the newbie."

In some ways, it is no different than the idea of asking demons or the deceased for magical favors in ancient literature.  But in concept and in the computer age it feels much different.  Well done.",how does magic carry out the details of all your wishes anyway?
5924,"The book helps you understand motivating forces for children from hard places. The author also draws the line so the child is not taught how to manipulate the parent.

5938,"This novel has underdeveloped characters and the plot seems forced. I wanted to know more about these characters, thoughts, etc..Don't get me wrong. It was readable. But it lacked the ""wow"" factor and was forgettable. The previous novels had an intuitive feel to them. The plot moved at just the right pace.

I had hoped it would be practical, ""now what do we do?"" topics, but it's about making you passionate and committed. If that's what you like reading, this book is for you. It wasn't for me.

Also not for non-Christian women."

6014,"This book is in need of a good edit. It's all telling and no showing, incorrect punctuation, tense changes, and enough adverbs to drive any reader crazy. Some sentences have words missing, or two sentences in a row are redundant. I read one-third of it and quickly skipped to the last ten pages just to finish the book. The ending is not a twist, but a totally unbelievable conclusion. Don't waste your time on this book.",This book is in need of a good edit. It's all telling and no showing
6015,"I will start with saying that Chelsea's TV show is too raw for me to watch but I bought this book for my brother, who thinks she is so outrageously funny, and wanted to get into reading more.  I thought I'd read the first chapter to check it out before I visited my brother and gave him the book. Well, I was hooked from page 1. Ladies, I tell you this book is ""pee your pants"" funny!  Outrageous and if all the chapters are real life, I would definitely recommend she see a psychologist, no offense meant. Highly entertaining.","who thinks she is so outrageously funny, and wanted to get into reading more"
6016,"This book was absolutely wonderful. Age appropriate themes and concepts are readily explained, making this easily relatable to children of all ages. The message behind the book, be yourself and triumphing through adversity is a message that all children (and adults) should learn.

Age appropriate themes and concepts are readily explained
6017,"Gripping from start to end. Kate Ross's books are simply ""must reads""--the Julian Kestrel four-book series ranks with the best of all the mysteries I have read, which numbers over 100.  I'm an avid Agatha Christie reader, particularly those that include Hercule Poirot.  One of my favorites is Endless Nights--read it if you have not--the ending is similar to  the ending in Cut to the Quick--both caught me by surprise.

One GOOD book!",A great mystery.  Just couldn't stop reading--the ending is a zinger!
6018,"I really enjoyed this book. The only thing I feel is that Dante's character and story could have been developed more over the course of two books. The climax and ending of this book were good, but I think it could have built up more had it been extended. I highly recommend this book and also the Breakers series for a good change of pace, but still a great read (or listen in my case, as I listen to books while I work on my kindle via text to speech).",I really enjoyed it but the main character deveoped really fast
6019,"A wealthy and world-weary young American takes passage on a a sailing vessel around the Horn of South America.  From the treatment of the scum they have for crew, it's no wonder there's a mutiny.  This book deserves a different ending, for by the time most of the crisis passes, the modern reader's sympathy lies with the scum.","An exciting Sea Yarn, from the point of view of the Superior race and class"
6020,"Even though I had not read the first two books in the Damien Dickens mysteries, this book stood on its own as an entertaining, thoroughly researched, thought-provoking mystery. Damien and Millie uncover murders, corporate malfeasance, dangerous bait-and-switch swindlers, and even Damien's psychologically-scarring history with dogs.  Phyllis Entis has done her research into situations, legalities, and locales so that the drama rings true. You will find yourself forgetting the outside world when you become immersed in this fascinating mystery.","Fascinating, entertaining, and stands alone for readers unfamiliar with the Damien Dickens series."
6021,Eagerly waiting the next in the series. I love Stephanie's romantic suspense stories and I'm hooked to this series. So much so that I'm on her upcoming releases page every other day!!!!!

6033,"I especially enjoyed the characters and their development was interesting. The story line takes several surprising turns that I was unprepared for, or not expecting, and was delighted it did not go too deeply into their times during the persecution of the Jewish community in WWII Germany. So many of the books in this genre that I have read recently did and I was not quite ready for more of the same. This story was a pleasant surprise in the way this subject was treated.

I learned so much about the racial dynamics that built this historic city and this book opened many doors to further research- of jazz musicians, madams, politicians and criminals. I can't wait to go to New Orleans and visit the sites of so many amazing events as the author provides all the specifics needed to investigate further.",Outstanding writing and fascinating account of early 1900's New Orleans
6036,"Excellent mental exercise and yet comfortable to read. I have returned to this book multiple times for insight and stimulating exercise. While the text is very reasonable, one must wonder about validity on some of the deduction made by the author and the lack of scientific backup. Nonetheless, this books greatest value is in getting the reader to think outside their square skull,",Your square skull will never be the same again - think - think - think says WTP - mental exercise has inherent value.

She teaches young readers to be proud of who they are.",This was one of my favorite books in elementary and junior high school
6041,"I love historical novels and have always been fascinated and repulsed by this particular character from history.  I think I would have enjoyed this more of it had just been set in the past.  I understand the authors point, but I think the story would have been good if she had just written about what occurred during Countess Elizabeth times and perhaps the ending would not have felt dull.

6043,"No bueno. I believe the title says it all.

If you love insta-love, cruel so-called hero's that won't listen to reason, heroines who shriek, heroines that roll over at the first kiss then this is the book for you.

The H is so horrible to the heroine it is scary. I just don't know where to go with this as for some readers it would be a 4 star due to the angst. Angst can be okay, even great, but there has to be something more than a one night stand to get you through it. I never bought it from either side.

Plus, there was a serious case of moppet.","Cruel hero, shrieking heroine, and a plot moppet. What's not to love. Eye roll."

Authenticity is key to achieve respect from your kids. But primarily, this book was a FUN thriller that I could NOT put down. I finished it while watching my kids school play last night, if that tells you how addictive the book is. I felt I knew Clare, I felt I knew Adele and Leo.

6046,"When Beyond the Ice Limit came out, I started it without going back 15 years and reading this book, The Ice Limit, first.  I kept going back and referring to The Ice Limit for clarity, but I really needed to reread it.  This was one of my first books from Preston & Child, and I had forgotten how terrific a book it is.  It's fast paced, well written, and a great read. Despite the authors' comment in Beyond the Ice Limit, it's really not a book you can read without reading Ice Limit first.  Oh, and Captain Britton's eyes are emerald green, not sapphire blue.","If you're reading Beyond Ice Limit, you need to read this first!"
6047,Great book for a historical perspective on how men treat fellow men in combat and how the effectiveness of modern combat forces has 'evolved'.  The freighting part of this book though is how those same training techniques are accidentally 'bleeding' into society and having a adverse and terrible effect.,Good historical study and current projection on how we treat each other when firearms are involved

It is the type of book you want to read quickly because you can't wait to see what happens next, but that you also enjoy so much you don't want it to end!  The characters stayed with me long after I finished the book.  I would recommend (and have) this book to everyone.",Great book with believable characters and wonderful story line.
6050,"I ordered the book because it intrigued me and was so glad I did. First, it is very well written and a real page turner. It was a book I needed to read as it made what has gone on in Afghanistan for so much longer than we realize. It begins in the last days of their having a king and takes us up to the modern days, following one young man. It is heartrending, but a book that I am so glad that I didn't miss.

6051,"This was my first read of Ms. Edwards.  I have to say I found it to be extremely well written, and had some twists that did surprise me.  I found the complexity of the characters wonderful.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I am glad I went into this read without knowing.  I didn't see the story ending as it did.  I tend to get a tad bit cranky when one ends in the way it did....

I read six of these books and they all tell a good story.",This cat mystery series by Sofie Kelly is fun and interesting and the characters are likable

I'm greatly intrigued by Jordel and I can't wait to learn more about him and the Mystics and the origins of the knife(night blade) that Loren keeps at her side.

6065,"I bought this to complete the Icerigger trilogy set in paperback (already had the first two). The book was a bit worn, but its over twenty years old so not too unexpected. I was hoping for a bit better quality based on the quality level it was listed as, but it would be hard to get a used copy of this now in really good condition so I'm satisfied.

Big fan of almost every novel ever written by Alan Dean Foster (except the Pip and Flinx novels, which never really caught my interest). He has a very creative mind and I treasure his work.","Good conclusion to the series, copy I bought was a bit beat up though"
6066,"I truly didn't think I was going to finish this book. It starts off at a run and then crawls it's way through the first act, but when it finishes, it finishes BIG.

There was a lot to love in this book: two fiery girls who trust nothing as much as each other, as well as commentary on racial and socioeconomic prejudices in 1920s Boston. It's just a great story and it's told with immense care. The entire concept of the novel is so fresh, it blew my mind.

I think it's a nice reading for those mid aged hardcore bikers, but a little bit disappointing for those readers who look for a pop culture point of view.

I seldom know what he is talking about when he is referring to various weapons but that is ok.

I liked the storyline, and I liked the main characters. I liked that Simon came back to make amends for his bad behaviour toward Emilia. I liked that Iris made him earn her forgiveness. I liked that the reasons were laid out later in the book, not up front.  Iris Parker has written a Stepbrother Romance with a lot of heart.

Niche would have been impressive.  Mass market, in an egalitarian sense, was brilliant.  Isaacson has obviously had to rush to complete the biography, which makes it a bit loose in places, but it is very readable, and that imperfection makes it more human in a sense.  I wanted to better understand a man that has been my hero for many years, and this book certainly helped me do this.","An excellent story about beauty, quality, drive and egalitarianism"

The plot is elegant, the key characters fleshed out to contrast the old locals who love their life with the new foreigners flush with money, unending ambition, and arrogance.

Burke has created an incredibly taut horror novel of loss of a loved one. This book hit me right in the gut, and Stephen is an incredibly sympathetic character.

It seemed like it was written more like a screenplay with the extreme attention to detail, than it was a book that would let your mind wander.

6141,Veronica Roth did a very good job developing characters and story lines in her first two books.  This book could have easily been split up into to more books given all the new characters and storylines she had introduced in Allegiant.

I did not meet my expectations after having read Divergent and Insurgent.,Did not live up to my expectations given the first two books.

6145,"This book was a huge eye-opener for me about how our current government came to be what it already was when I arrived on the scene. The tragedy of history is that everyone assumes what they grow up with to be normal, and it isn't until you read something like this that you come to understand the perverse basis for it all and realize it's completely honorable and worthwhile to push for rolling all the useless stuff back out and restoring the principles of what this country was founded on.",You'll never view the US government the same after you read this

6147,"I saw that this was originally a much shorter story, which was lengthened by Ms. Miller.  Like the bandaid being ripped off quickly, she should have left it alone.  Shorter would have been much less painful for this reader.

Authors should leave their earlier publications alone.  Even if it was not a good book, it's just embarrassing when the author tries to fix it  -- and inevitably makes it worse.

6150,"This series just keeps getting better and more addictive. Gotta warn you - if you enjoyed the first book, you'll have to just fork out for the rest of the series. The only thing that is a bit off in an amusing way is that most of the female characters are blonde or red heads (the author clearly has a thing for them). And they're all gorgeous, of course. But if you can get over that, it's a great series. And I love Will and Danny; what a great duo.

6152,"Overall I really liked this book. Although it is yet another alien invasion of Earth novel, it's much different from other books about the same thing. I loved all the interesting ideas Rick Yancey had, for instance what the 5th wave turned out to be. Although the first 95% of the book is completely different than any other alien invasion novel I've read, sadly the final 5% is the expected cliche ending. The book starts out strong, but loses some steam at the end. Would I recommend it, yes. It's still a good book, it just could have been better.","So close to being a classic, but still a twist on the typical alien invasion novel."

The atmosphere at many universities is becoming increasingly hostile, especially if you are straight and Christian.

This book begins and ends with written paragraphs that explain what the book of White Collar is about. In between, you get to enjoy the amazing graphics that are used to show the story.

The illustrations truly emphasized the statement that says; "" a picture is worth a thousand words"" .

Not only did I enjoy reading White Collars, but I also ended up learning a valuable historic lesson.

I give it 4.5/5 stars.","The illustrations truly emphasized the statement that says; "" a picture is worth a thousand words"" ."

6279,The answer is no. I love the Day by Day world purely because of how wonderfully JLB writes it. Its about style and the sense of realism he offers. Right from book one and the outbreak its been a tense and frantic journey as the world dies. Very much looking forward to more zombie apocalypse magic from one of the masters.,Its Day by Day by J.L.Bourne. Could it be anything other than awesome.
6280,"I voluntarily reviewed a free copy of The Tower Princess.

It was a good book, I liked the premise and everything. It was just a bit more slow-going for me than what I liked. I liked Gressa's character and how she comes more into her own as the book goes on. I also kind of really liked the Woodlings(specifically the King). I thought it was pretty clever what he did to allow Gressa and Manny to meet. I just wished the book had picked-up the pace a bit.",Not a bad book. Just a little slower paced than what I prefer.

Undeveloped characters, a political subplot about Eire joining the EEC (DON'T DO IT, LADS!!!!) which is foiled at a concert where a song turns the vote. Huh?

I do not like all of the little assignments they seem a little hooky to me, but the subject matter is giving me an appreciation of my own artistic abilities.  I have always enjoyed to work of other artists, not realizing that I have something important to contribute.  We all do.

However, the recipes in this book were so good that I didn't mind doing the protocol nearly as much as I thought I would.

It was certainly an emotional rollercoaster ride, and I'm still processing how I feel.

Interesting story between these two that makes their marriage ideal.  A must read. Errors throughout the book, while aggravating, do not hinder the story.  Still found it hard to believe that the Wickhams were allowed to come to Pemberley.

For a book of it's type (fantasy / action) the plot is surprisingly detailed and complex. It builds a world of magic, characters, and politics on the level of or better than the Harry Potter series.

It's too discombobulated by far and has many absolutely irrelevant scenes that add nothing of value except to prolong the book.

I could identify with the young boy and with the mouse and it was comforting to know that it was a children's book so would probably have a good ending.  Nevertheless it was suspenseful.  I would recommend it to any adventurous goodhearted kid,A delightful book; I'm so glad I've discovered Beverly Cleary

I like that it is written to a level that is easily understood, yet technical enough to be of worth.  Some of the tasks describe may well be out of the ability of the average user, but it gives you a firm understanding of what the gunsmith is doing, so that you can speak intelligently if you need to get some work done on your guns.

I read the second book first. It was about Cam and Joline. I liked it so much that I read this book to learn about Marley and why Cam became a psychiatrist instead of a lawyer.

I have read several bios of EH and knew some general facts about his marriage to Pauline Pfeifer ,but this book provided more detail on the strengths, weaknesses and eventual deterioration of said marriage.  On the other hand,  too much detail was given on the Pfeifer family in the first chapters of the book to the point that I almost lost interest.

That is fine, but I sometimes feel that when the author focuses on a female character with sort of a traditionally butch job that she tries too hard to convince us that a woman can do what use to be mens work and still be straight and sometimes girly.

The setting for the story really sets this book apart from others in this genre - The author does an excellent job of moving the action through Soviet-era Moscow. The oppresiveness is palatable, the politicians corrupt, and the weather so bad you may need to get out your winter coat before the story ends.

Martin Cruz Smith brings home the bacon with this story - two frostbitten thumbs up.","An excellent police procedural, blended with a taste of Soviet culture"
6404,"This book is extremely poorly written. I bought it to see why the author had been arrested and fired from his position as a teacher for having written it. The contents of the story are difficult to untangle, as he seems to have had multiple thesauri in play while writing it, however I strongly disagree with his being persecuted for this. Yes, there is a school massacre in here - but there is no exhortation to commit such an act. If merely writing (badly) about it is enough to get one thrown in jail, then I think the trouble lies well *outside* the pages of any book.","Not well written, but the legal persecution of the author needs to be countered"
6405,"The writing itself was ok but I HATED the non-ending. As a previous reviewer called it, bait and switch. I won't download another of this author's books since this is they cannot be bothered to finish a book. I don't care to have to hunt for another book to finish a story line. Very disappointed to have wasted my time reading a book that wasn't finished.","Disappointed, No Ending, Just Stops in the Middle of the Story"
6406,"What can I say, the bible I receive is in good condition with nice large readable print, a 2011 NIV addition with nice imitation leather cover.

6408,"Romance, clean,
This was by far the best book of Julie Daines I have read. Not perfect, but it was very engaging, intense, and still had the magic of the two main characters falling all over again for each other and finding the truth of the past. Elaine and Gareth's past and the mystery with regard to the smugglers and her brother's death, the long held secret made for an engaging and lovely read.
Interesting premise, and a lovely fall.","Mystery and romance, secrets from the past made for a lovely read!"

Dzintra has done it again with another wonderful addition to the Halfway House Series....

6410,"I think the author delved into a part of Arab society that most citizens of that country are blissfully unaware of. I have known many young Saudi students and when asked about woman and how they are treated, they all reply that women are treated respectfully and have lots of freedom. In this story, I could see how these young men could be blind to what is happening around them. Every single one of them has told me that their first sexual experience happened with the family maid when they were under 15 and a few told me they had been to prostitutes out of their city. It is a strange country.",this is a great book and shows the world a dark corner of Saudi Arabia.

Keep on reading, though:  worth the wading.","Family,  Two ""One True Faith""s, Catherine and Edgar in Brittain"
6412,"So many voices, so many stories. I contributed to the Kickstarter for this book, and it was well worth it. These are stories from the non-western, non-anglicized world. Told in voices I'd never heard before, some stuck fast and I couldn't get them out of my head. All of the stories are speculative. Some are terrifying, others tell tales of loss, the aftermath of war, ghosts, the love of home and family. Each story is illustrated by talented artists and the cover is gorgeous. It's a fantastic collection. Buy two, because you're going to wear one out.",Definitive collection of speculative fiction for a global audience.
6413,"Dreadfully disappointed.  I felt the author did not even try to match the voice and times from 200 years ago.  People should also be aware that the book's heroine suffers vile abuse, which likely did happen, but is hardly appropriate for this genre.  Overall, clunky, depressing, and not worth the time.",Only for those who like to read about wives and daughters being horribly abused.

They're just fine. I'm glad this book has so many examples.

So, each example is making a certain point and each serves a purpose. I like this uncomplicated book!",Water Soluble Colored Pencils---As Delightful As the Book Says They Are.
6416,"Enjoyable mystery, although I figured out the chip business very quickly and had a good idea of who the bad guys were.  I have cats, and they are microchipped, so the hand scanner gave that part away.  I did like the characters and there were no over the top obnoxious characters in people's faces, nor a bunch of antics and stupid ideas by the protagonist to fill up more pages.  That is one of my pet peeves.",although I figured out the chip business very quickly and had a good idea of who the bad guys were

The story tells about Karate Class in a way that captures the mood, the energy and the control of the class.  Illustrations are low color but high realism, light bleached images.  The illustration (Bill Thomson) uses a variety of ""camera angle"" to add to the story.  Unexpected, from below or from above images.  Very still and very dynamic poses.  Wonderful use of image as the story.  I also appreciate that he includes both male and female children  and children of a variety of ethnic heritages.

6419,"I chose to rate this a five-star because of its understanding to me. The book communicated to me an understanding of the life, times, and words of Jesus that was at a different, more personal level or humanistic level than the readings from the Bible.

""The Life and Times of Jesus: From His Earthly Beginnings to the  Sermon on the Mount (Part I)"" provided a secular line to my spiritual line, completing the circle of life for the Son of Man for me. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and heartedly recommend it.

6420,"The book is semi-autobiographical.  It's written in the usual Jack London style -- strong verbs, unshaded emotions,  characters that are either good or bad, sharply drawn scenes,  political ideas rarely discussed in his other books, and an ending that is meant to be tragic, but perhaps also or inadvertently reveals the emotional immaturity of the hero.  Its appeal will be greater for younger [people and literary historians -- and for

Also very inspirational in terms of the influence of Yeshua in teaching love and forgiveness.

6469,"Mr. Fierstein made Polaroid, the management team at Kodak, the judge, and especially Dr. Land all come alive as well-developed characters on stage for this delightful and entertaining read. It was reassuring to read insights from someone who worked with Land closely during a very critical period in his career, to learn more about the very private Dr. Land, and I especially appreciated the exhaustive research that Mr. Fierstein shared with his readers to give his story so much credibility.",Very well documented and entertaining insight to Dr. Land's genius
6470,"Wonderful plot line, and character development. I have read some of his later books, and found them canned, lame, and not near the quality of this book.

6471,I have read this book a couple of times since the 90s. The plot is wonderful but a lot of differences from Suspicion besides the ending.  I like it better than the movie. The last time I read it (getting towards the end) a tree branch fell (it was storming) and I was so immersed in the book I jumped a couple of feet in the chair. Beware..they drink a lot of whiskey so I bought a small bottle to enhance the scenes!,Better than the movie ...one of the best atmospheric mysteries
6472,"Ninie Hammon has written another master piece. Her ""homestyle"" way of presenting her storyline is perfect.

6473,"The only impressive story in here was Dark Crime and that started off exciting and ended up like a typical Carpathian book. Carpathian meets destined virgin and totally takes over her life. Honestly the same M.O. Is the reason I no longer preorder any of  Christine's books anymore. The other 2 stories in the book were just a waste of my time, energy and money. Maggie Shayne's writing had deteriorated to me as well. The last author I am unfamiliar with but if this was any indication of her work I'll just stop here. All in all not worth the money I spent on it.",... Crime and that started off exciting and ended up like a typical Carpathian book
6474,"I have read the Kara Gilliam series from the beginning.  I do not recommend you begin later than the very first book, because people and circumstances and what we think we know all changes very fast.  I have occasionally gone back to re-read the previous book when a new book is published just so I can recall who's on which side of the war, and even what each side allegedly stands for.  So the main reservation I have about this series is that some homework is required.  Aside from that, I really enjoy Ms. Rowland's writing, her characters, & her world-view.","Do your homework, and then enjoy a great book in an excellent series."
6475,"This is one of the most beautiful and insightful spiritual books I have read, and I've read a lot of them. An absolute must for any library, this book takes the best tenets of the great teachings from all the world religions, including Christianity, and ties them all together into a beautiful allegory that makes it easy to understand - and better yet, to integrate into one's daily life. There are many lessons to be learned within these pages, and it is wondrously written. Highly recommended reading.",This is one of the most beautiful and insightful spiritual books I have read

Good stuff and cant wait for whats next.",Didn't think I was going to enjoy Fighting Iron but boy was I wrong
6477,"I received a copy from the author and I voluntarily reviewed this book.

This was an entertaining read.  Leo went from being out of control to self denial to willing to do anything to keep Lysa and his child.  The author did a great job with Leo and his brother's relationship and their background.  I loved Trouble's no-nonsense, irritable, violence threatening tirades.  By the title you can tell that there is a BDSM theme and sex scenes but the plot itself is fairly sweet and Leo proves his good intentions repeatedly.

Grab it and enjoy!",Kinda sweet and fairly dirty with a touch of Trouble for fun!

Looking forward to her next novel.,"Another Great, Suspenseful, Can't-put-it-down mystery thriller by Rachel Abbott!!!"

* He confuses memes, which are cultural units, with thoughts, which are not. Since we are talking about a ""virus of the mind"" this means that he is saying ""thoughts are the virus of the mind.""
* He believes that memes function as viruses, but it would be clearer to say that they function symbiotically and compare them to bacteria.","Mr. Brodie has a limited understanding of biology, viruses, and genetics."

6486,"I enjoyed this book which takes the reader into the post cold war Cuba of today. Much has been written of Castro, Cuba and the cold war but this book is different from that past literature. In a breath of fresh air the author even speculates what will happen after Fidel finally shuffles off that mortal coil. So has Castro he even has set up military and secret police protocols to ensure his revolution endures after his passing. This book should be read by all who care about Cuba, its relations with the USA and the freedom of it's people.","Takes a unique look at Castro, the Cuban diaspora, and the future of Cuba"
6487,Wow... This was a disappointing and useless end arc.  The main story had been wrapped up well enough in the previous collected volume (Vol #4).  This just disappointingly sets up the story to continue with some new characters.  It reduces the character of Amanda Waller who'd story had been told in the last few volumes.,"Skip this, just read upt to Volume 4 and pretend this part never happens."
6488,"Very sweet little book about a man and his dog. It's too bad he brought some politics into some of it. But most of the book was very sweet besides the political asides. Definitely not a fan of Michael Savage's politics.

If he didn't put some of his hatred of liberals and Islam there it would have been four stars. I just got a sense as a conservative radio host he couldn't resist it.

His love for Teddy and his other dogs was very, very sweet.","Lovely story about the dogs, didn't need any political asides"
6489,"Oregon is full of great spots to visit, some day trips from Portland, others a longer stay. (Note: I'm focusing on Oregon because I live in the Portland area; I know much less about Seattle/Washington.) This book certainly hits the highlights in Oregon and does a pretty good job of laying things out so that you know how much time you should plan for each particular excursion. However, I felt like it doesn't offer enough details on what's interesting about the trips -- especially when it comes to the downtown Portland section.",Okay in terms of identifying spots in Oregon/Washington but sparse on details

It moves from present day to memories or lack of them in John's case, from 30 years ago. It is easy to follow the double stranded story and it becomes obvious that both worlds will collide. Baldacci makes you like bad people and cheer when good people do bad things, that wouldn't be normal. A page turner that keeps you reading when you should be sleeping.","A cold case of a different kind, with deadly consequences for today."
6494,"I really tried to like this book but just couldn't manage it. I did finish it and it seems to be an over-detailed travelogue of the Lake Superior region and its history with a little bit of plot mixed it. And it also seems to be the first of a trilogy, all involving this long, slow, tedious investigation. I was bored by the first book and can't even imagine reading the remaining two.

6496,"This book has really helped me to understand self compassion and to realize that Im not so kind to myself and am always seeking validation and acceptance from others. To be honest, I thought self compassion was like having higher self esteem or believing in yourself but this book has made me realize that theres so much more to it than that. The self compassion exercises in the book are really helpful, I have learnt to be kind to myself and to accept myself for who I am and to stop wishing to be like someone else.

It had been recommended as a resource for a Bible study for women on grief and loss.  It won't work well for that, but will be a wonderful resource for working with children and youth.

6519,"Solid book. No great literary feats going on here, but this is a premiere vampire/apocalypse story, and a rare occurrence of an author pulling off a novel while focusing on just one character. The drama is gripping, the writing on task, and while this apocalypse supposedly happened in 1976, the book does not feel dated (so long as you can put the actual dates out of mind).

And of course, I loved being back on Celta and renewing acquaintance with characters from previous stories in the series.  I wish Robin wrote faster, because these come too far apart for me.  This one was particularly good in that Avellana's character is fully developed, and she is not a shrinking violet.  She makes an excellent heartmate for the Prophet of Celta.","Good solid romance, plus resolves some issues from the ongoing series."

The main character's life intersects major historical events, and the book really brings alive the era of Carnegie and Mellon. The author's painstaking research is obvious, but the reader is so immersed in her world that it never seems like a history lesson. The parallels between the panic of 1873 and the banking crisis of 2008 are eerie, and the growing pains of the American economy during this period should serve as a cautionary tale for our modern age.",Brings to life an overlooked but important period in American history

Author Ursula Bielski did a great job of researching, writing and interviewing
countless people about the lore, history and paranormal events that make for very
interesting Chicago legends, stories and lore.

There are many interesting stories and accounts in this book of ghosts and poltergeists

6613,I love the concept of creating a God loving world that Mick creates.  He is very creative with the names that he comes up with.  However at times it is difficult to follow because he introduces new characters with each story and new places in the Wordishure world.  More character development and descriptions of this new world are needed.  I think the world of Wordishure could be as compelling as Narnia if more time is spent describing this world.  I rate it 3 stars for creativity.,"Great concept, but more character and plot development needed"

Anthony Doerr is a master of the short story. Here he lifts many of the themes and images of the stories into a tale set firmly in a civilian world  rudely intruded  by war.

He mms ads most of them to be of a fighting, warlike nature and there are many battles in this story.  He also has a romance with a woman of a race similar to humans on Mars.  What impressed me is that the writer knew that the air on Mars was not breathable for man of r beast, but he devised an invention to remedy that.

I will probably read the next book to see where the story is going, but there were sections of excessive descriptive text with little plot development I had to skim through and which repeatedly disrupted my interest in the narrative. In the beginning there were various defenses of goth culture that read like amateur psychology and there is an apparent fascination with the concept of homosexuality (the latter, so far, has had nothing to do with the story), which may be attempts to identify with potential readers.",Has potential.

We often read them together, to take advantage of the 'teachable moments' found for both of us.  As a history buff and emerging history buff, we both enjoy the content and style very much.

She loves to laugh at men doing various kinds of pratfalls.  I just wanted to see how it was done.  Answer:  very cheaply.  I still love ROCKETSHIP X-M, and SUPERMAN & THE MOLE MEN.

Although his style is considerably different, David Lewis can spin a yarn with the best of them. His characters are well developed early in the story and his use of western vernacular is refreshingly authentic.

6794,"Great book with great insight. Considering our political climate and how many families are struggling with division, this gives a lot of insight. Somehow we are full of broken people. I'm not sure if we are reaping results of indulging our children too much or what forces are at work among us. I only know this author pointed out so many behaviors that I had been fooled by for years.",Well worth the read. Especially for families struggling with behavior issue
6795,"I'm not sure what to say about this book except for the fact that I believe everyone should read it. This book is heartwarming and definitely teaches a huge lesson in racial profiling. This book made me angry, made me laugh, and made me cry. Rose Mashal definitely did her homework to write Black Keys, the information provided in this book about Muslims and Arabs is spot on. I have already read it 3 times and am going to read it again once my daughter is finished with it. Can't wait for the second in the trilogy!","Amazing, well researched, well written book by an amazing author"

6797,"Excellent historical telling of WWII as viewed from Patton's perspective, and of those around him, Eisenhower, Bradley, Montgomery. Interesting how Roosevelt didn't micromagange his generals but rather let the professionals run and win the war. It is an objective view of these historical figures, the decisions they made, some right and some wrong.",Excellent historical telling of WWII as viewed from Patton's perspective
6798,"I recently finished John Zelle's book 'Python Programming'.  I had paid for a Coursera course and bought other Python books before finding this wonderful book.  Buy this book to (1) learn to program in Python and (2) understand the big picture Computer Science of why you are making these programming choices.  As a mathematician and a teacher, I recommend this book.

6799,I would recommend reading Tom Sawyer before reading this as it helps to know the characters. It is perfect if you enjoy Twain's classic or if you just want to read a really good book that is filled with humor and social commentary.  This book speaks to several problems during this time period.  I really enjoyed this book and it made me want to go back and read Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn and other stories by Mark Twain.  I highly recommend it.,Great for Twain Fans or if you just want to read a good book.
6800,"Didn't like it as much as I liked the previous book in the same series (Cinderella murder).
I had to force myself to read it because I couldn't quite connect to the characters. I didn't like how the main character was stringing along her love-interest.
Overall interesting read, but I guess my hopes were too high after the first book (Cinderella murder).",I guess my hopes were too high after the first book in the series.
6801,"I read this as part of the Death Lies & Ducttape series & really liked it a lot.  The characters are well drawn, interesting and I want to know more about them.  The story was interesting, with twists & turns which made you very sympathetic to the thief & the detective.  I will keep this author on my lists of who to buy in the future!",Interesting plot and characters worth exploring in more depth!
6802,Laura and Adam meet in Vegas when she is there with her girlfriend for a bachelorette party for a week and he is there for three weeks on business. He sells medical equipment across the country. They see each other for the first time on the casino floor when she has just won a jackpot on a slot machine and he is at the craps table. She jobs him after he buys her a drink. Their one night stand turned into three weeks. Then that turned into an additional six well road trip...

It's so REAL feeling, one would almost think this was someone's real life story.  From book 1 to the end of 3, you as the reader was right there feeling EVERYTHING this family was going through.  Emotions, excitements, frustrations, decievings, misleadings, lies, secrets, parties, weddings, courtrooms, ranch, beach, pool, camping, sex, drugs..........need I say more - this series has it all!!!!","Amazed, Unreal, Fabulous, BEST series read in a long long time!"
6804,"Nash was always the character in the previous books that I loved to hate.  He liked having fun in life and with women and wasn't afraid to speak his mind, even if it made others mad.  That is also what Velvet loved and hated about him.  I really enjoyed reading about these two and seeing how they both overcame the obstacles that were thrown at them and how their relationship developed.",... always the character in the previous books that I loved to hate
6805,"As soon as I started reading the book I couldn't put it down, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. When I first start reading this book I thought it was going to be a science fiction book about aliens and space travel. I was surprised that aside from the first few chapters of this book we rarely see or hear anything about aliens or space travel. Rather this book is more similar to a time travel fiction book like the ring of fire series than anything else. It a great book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good time travel fictions.","If you enjoy the ring of fire series, I would highly recommend you give this book a try."
6806,"We love these books. My 12-year old, who doesn't love anything that does not have electricity running through it, loves these books. We've been reading them together for the past year or so. Thanks, Trenton Lee Stewart, for adventurous stories that, while showing protagonists with real foibles, also heighten the importance of personal character qualities like friendship, endurance, loyalty and trust. Sadly, this is lost on most of YA literature in the present age.","Great Finish to a Great Series (if your a Tweener, or a Tweener's Dad)"

However, even if your site or disrtict is not following the formal DuFour PLC structure, you will still find strong resources to guide your leadership and work.

I am eager to use their bibliograhy as my next reading list.",Great resource -supported by leadership research - for site and district leaders
6808,"A really erudite and entertaining trip through the development of major sciences in the world. Explanations of difficult concepts are far more clear than one typically expects, and the author uses analogies and a great deal of humor to help get points across.  Author's stories about the personality patterns of various famous scientists are quite interesting. The book was published in 2003 as I recall, so a little material is somewhat dated, mostly in regard to discoveries in the realm of genetics. This minor problem in no way detracts from the overall accuracy and interest of the book.",Informative and entertaining exploration of the development of the major sciences & scientific discoveries

Beyond both having ""M.D."" after their name, the striking similarities are the stories only they can tell by having imagined the scenarios from their work as doctors and putting those tales on the page for all to enjoy.

6811,"An overblown book. Very little insight into how major professional sports enrich billionaire owners and multi-millionaire players and distorts that part of society that invests irrational support at the expense of the needs of wider society. Even the term ""fans"" has been inflated to ""fan base"" -- depersonalizing even those who want to enjoy sports.","Even the term ""fans"" has been inflated to ""fan base"" -- depersonalizing even those who want to enjoy sports."
6812,"I'm glad I read the book first before seeing the great series based on this book. Liane Moriarty is truly a unique voice. It's hard to describe the effect her writing has on me- it's like I'm somehow part of her group of friends and I've somehow slipped inside her body and share all of her opinions now.
Weird,  but a really fun experience. Plus she knows how to build up some suspense!",I love this author. I now live in Australia (through her eyes!).

6814,"All the strengths and weaknesses of Dickens are highlighted in this rather long novel.

The strengths: humour, engaging plot, insightful descriptions and regular passages of beautifully-written prose.

Weaknesses: syrupy sentiment, a lack of aspiration to rise above pulp fiction, and one-dimensional characters - especially the annoyingly perfect main character, Esther.","Funny and well written, but weak characterisation and lacks thematic strength"

I found myself shaking my head in acknowledgement of the familiar antics of this outspoken family, and even caught myself chuckling many times. Clair Cook manages to give this story a nice fresh coat that keeps the reader interested and involved in the real world issues of Sarah, John and their family and friends.

6819,"It was good enough I read the second book but I stalled out after that.

This is a love triangle book (I prefer a real relationship story to this should I could guy A or guy B stuff). The main character is a bit flaky and didn't work for me. I think she's meant to be a strong female lead but she didn't come across that way. She kept trying to go it alone when it was plain she would fail and then failed and had to get bailed out by one of her men. She didn't seem to think things through very well.

It didn't work for me. Would not recommend.","Love triangle with a ""not really strong"" female lead -Would not recommend"

While on assignment he takes comfort in a cat house and after being 'serviced' by Annie she tells him she was kidnapped five years ago and begs him to help her.  This story is beautifully told love story and is heart wrenching and heartwarming.  He plans a rescue and there are surprises, twists and a mystery.

Even when I placed the CDs in my PC, they would not display or play properly in Windows Media Player. I put them in my car CD player, absolutely no play. So for that I'm not sure what rating to give it.

But, once I started to study the words, I found out that definitions of some of the words are rather complicated to explain the meaning/s of the words. The example sentences are not helpful either.
