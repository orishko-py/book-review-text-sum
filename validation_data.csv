0,"Really good story, terrific characters, and no cliffhanger!!! </s>","summarize: This was a very good book.  The Main Characters were well developed and very mature.  They do not suffer from the silliness and one dimensional characterizations that often plague NA romance.  Lucy was adorable and Jensen was her perfect foil.  It is so refreshing to have a complete, believable, enjoyable story with a really good HEA.  No cliffhanger - thank goodness!! </s>"
1,The Righteous Among the Nations: Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust </s>,"summarize: I learned from my biological sister in 2005 that I am part Jewish. Her hobby was genealogy.  This was exciting to me.  ""Righteous Among the Nations: Rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust"" was and is very meaningful to me because I have an ancestor that was in the Holocaust.  My 2nd visit to Yad Vashem last March was emotional due to the fact that I did not know about my Jewish heritage the first time I went to Israel in 1991.  Le Chaim! </s>"
2,... and raised in the Texas Panhandle just as the horrible drought was ending </s>,"summarize: I was born and raised in the Texas Panhandle just as the horrible drought was ending. Mom, Dad and my older siblings lived through it and were forever changed by it, so it's a story that strikes very close to home. Several members of my family still live in Dalhart, Texas, the center of the drought and the very melancholy story. </s>"
3,"My 3 year old daughter, 9 year old daughter and Wife LOVE this book </s>","summarize: I love this book and had to buy our own personal copy after borrowing it from the library.
My 3 year old wants me to read this book daily. She literally has memorized it and reads it to me at times.

Wish the author would come out with more Mimi books.

Beautiful Pictures / 3d Art.
Absolutely lovable charater.  Short but very sweet and touching story line. </s>"
4,End of a saga. Worth the read and certainly an important story. </s>,"summarize: Every Discworld novel is worth its weight in gold. Sadly this was Sir Terry's last. He died, alas! The novel was shortened by Sir Terry's illness and did not have the meat and bones or the humor his earlier novels had - understandable. Yet the story was important and did much to place the protagonist in the proper perspective and allowed fans to say goodbye to one of the other series' protagonist. It was a sad ending to over forty novels filled with wonder, and adventure, and comedy, and not least, drama. Goodbye Terry. Rest in peace. </s>"
5,"Don't even think of reading it as a standalone, but better than Menace!! </s>","summarize: BOOM!! J. M. Darhower nailed it with another winning story!
The exciting conclusion of Lorenzo and Morgan's story aka Scarlet. Grievous picks up right where Menace left off so don't even try to read it as a standalone!
This story was full of intense twists and turns, the conclusion of this series was even better than book 1!
What can I say...Morgan wanted a fairy tale but instead her Prince Charming gave her a devilishly dirty  ride! </s>"
6,A masterfully told tale that peeks in to a world that few of us know about. </s>,"summarize: Wow - this was a rare book where the whole time I read it, I had no doubt that this one would merit five stars.  The author masterfully introduced me to a new culture, and unfamiliar circumstance, and added realistic tension that kept me turning the pages.  I won't give away spoilers, but readers will be riveted by all of the possible outcomes - life, death, love, hate, marriage, divorce, forgiveness, anger.  I liked what the author chose in the end. </s>"
7,Just ruined a $30 piece of Salmon...save yourself a lot of pain and pass on this book. </s>,"summarize: New to smoking food and thought this book, based on the reviews, would be a good guide to use and learn.  Have tried several recipes with very mediocre results.  Created a marinade EXACTLY per the recipe.  My wife commented that the America Test Kitchen version of a very similar marinade made a big point to reduce the amount of salt and omit other ingredients.  Already had the fish soaking in my marinade so couldn't modify the recipe.  Too bad since the salmon came out and it was a hot mess...had to toss it in the trash...totally inedible.

Took this book and tossed it too. </s>"
8,Great book. I highly recommend it to everybody who has a heart. </s>,"summarize: It took me a while to read this book because I was afraid of its ending. I thought that I would be disappointed. I wasn't. I had tears when I finished the book. The book has so many different angles, family issues, justice, corruption, commitment and so many other things. I can't wait to buy the author's other books. Please read this book. You will not be disappointed. </s>"
9,And you can go to YouTube andwatch her prepare many of the recipes </s>,"summarize: It is the classic. And you can go to YouTube and watch her prepare many of the recipes, or at least the master recipes, in the book. I originally purchased this as a e-book. Huge mistake. You often need to refer to other parts of the book, and the e-book navigation is a total disaster in this respect. </s>"
10,"HOT, UNIQUE AND VERY DEVELOPED AND AMAZING CHARACTERS FILL THIS ONE, ESPECIALLY GRANNY </s>","summarize: First time reading this author, but I have to say I like the story and the characters.  The story is different and the characters are fun and amazing.  I loved the Guardian shifter Damon and of course Ava was an inspiration  Not only was she a powerful character she was a rare shifter species besides everything else.

I have to say I will read this author again and I believe that since this one was a free be there is no way you can loose with this one.  I am sure that once you start to read it you will be glad you did. </s>"
11,"Courageous, redemptive, sensuous, massively entertaining story...Loved it. </s>","summarize: Jason's courage and commitment to raise his daughter--himself young and inexperienced in life, fuels a story that is real, vulnerable and filled with creative tension. Jason discovers through his hesitant connection with Ben, a Ranger, that he may have the capacity to let relationships and happiness back into his life, after a holiday that turns terrifying. </s>"
12,Trilogies by Jerry Guarino Trilogies: 18 Sets of Short Fiction </s>,"summarize: Trilogies is a collection of 54 short stories grouped in sets of three all based on similar themes. There is a little something for everyone. A wild array of short stories and flash fiction. Jerry Guarino writes with humor , some satire and pathos, his characters are engaging he reveals their flaws and goals. I look forward to reading more books by him. </s>"
13,"Our irrational impulses, shared with the legends of the heavenly and hellish bodies. </s>","summarize: A fundamental reference for anyone interested in Indian mythology (and basis of numerous Greek stories).  This is a very enjoyable and wondrous book to read.  It can also be re-read over and over to stimulate the irrational centers of the brain and bring the reader into harmony with the clash of biology and society, family and individual conflicts.  In this form it is aptly described by the author as a ""therapeutic myth.""  A must have for any yoga teacher. </s>"
14,I found that I could get this book for free so I thought it was a good chance to check it out </s>,summarize: I had never heard much of the raw food diet. I found that I could get this book for free so I thought it was a good chance to check it out. It is a fantastic cookbook. The recipes and ideas are so easy to follow and the ingredients are mostly things I have in my home anyways. Excellent add to my cookbook collection. </s>
15,The causes of great recession (tough to follow in an audiobook) </s>,"summarize: Ties many characters and their adventures together chronologically and across the regulatory landscape.

Once you understand all of it, though, wouldn't you want to join these devils?

Don't fret as there is enough time. Sadly nothing has been done to prevent something like this from happening again in the future. </s>"
16,"Science, Space, Military, Aliens, distant star systems, FTL travel, War on the doorstep ... what else could you want? </s>","summarize: Storyline includes hardcore non-military scientific types and of course space faring military which alone would make it a great read. However, the addition of an alien species that lost as much as the humans did against the Merkiarri and the hope of an alliance running out of time, makes for an better than ""great"" read. Enjoy! </s>"
17,Creativity can't be taught but Creativity Inc. help you understand how to unleash its powers. </s>,"summarize: Ed Catmull's method of explaining and writing about the creative culture took me completely by surprise and I couldn't be more delighted with the read. Creativity, Inc. is an autobiography of Ed Catmull and Pixar and somehow seamlessly educates us on everything from the thought process to the execution of creativity in business and product creation. It is an interesting story and a fantastic read. I highly recommend this book. </s>"
18,The forming of a valuable relationship shown in an entertaining manner </s>,"summarize: This is a truly entertaining book although it's also hugely instructive.  Through delightful fable, we see how mentoring is developed and nurtuted.  viewed in the terms of relationship between mentor and mentee we see bonds developed to the benefit of both parties.  This is must reading for both mentors and mentees </s>"
19,One of the best books to come out on this subject in a decade </s>,"summarize: I highly recommend this book, and not just because the authors cite my writing on St. Omer Cemetery! Unlike a lot of similar books that have come out since 1999, the authors have clearly visited all the locations in the book and have included original research and observations. As a bonus, they have gone out of their way to find obscure places that haven't been written about before. I cite this book extensively in my own work about haunted places in Illinois and I definitely consider it a 'must read' for any fan of the genre. </s>"
20,Thanks for painting a good picture and keeping us in the fictional Land </s>,"summarize: This is just exactly as addicting as it should be.  Limited spelling errors and grammar errors, although be careful on your character names.  Some spelling errors within that.  Keep killing it... and give us more of a challenge next time.  Thanks for painting a good picture and keeping us in the fictional Land. </s>"
21,"after hearing so many people say it was a great read, I read it </s>","summarize: I read a brief review of this when it first came out, and was expecting something else, just a story of a woman who made up stories about the lives of those she sees from her commuter train. However, after hearing so many people say it was a great read, I read it. It was so much better than I expected, a psychological thriller that opened up my mind to reading so many more like it, if there even is anything like it. Somewhat like Gone Girl, which I also loved, however don't equate the main characters, because they are nothing alike. </s>"
22,This became one of my all time favorite novels. Absolutely could not put it down </s>,"summarize: This became one of my all time favorite novels. Absolutely could not put it down. The humor was as original as were the endearing characters and unexpected storyline. I marvel at the imagination Miss Harmon has. I have read romance novels since 1972, this one gave me everything I look for in a novel.  Her knowledge of pirates and ships of that era were both enlightening as well as entertaining. Don""t miss this one! I have now read all of Danelle Harmon's novels and would highly recommend any one of them. </s>"
23,This is really a pleasure. I bought a bunch of (used) copies and gave them away. </s>,"summarize: Read it fast, its getting dated quickly, unlike me in my thirties. It's really a sweet book with some lines and scenes that are astonishingly imaginative and really flocking hilarious. This is a serious author who's really letting it rip on all of us, but ultimately in a really affectionate way, turning Sartre's dictum upside-down. I guess all the critics beat me to that one ten years ago. Mr. Butler sir, I salute you. Any women who would leave you for some old businessman...., ah, who am I to judge, whore and fool that I am. Forget all that. Read the book, the rest of you. </s>"
24,"Fabulous story about a famous Viking, which had much impact on the history of Euroope. </s>","summarize: The Viking Gngu Hrlfur (Walking  Hrolf ( is a well known crater in the Icelandic Saga. There it is said that he was so big that no horse could bear him. The author is possibly correct that Hrolf could not ride the small Norwegian ponies. What makes makes Hrolf famous in the Saga, is that he occupied Normandy. campaign, later led to the occupation of Britain , by William  the Bastard. </s>"
25,Who the hell put those reviews (obviously from another book) here? </s>,"summarize: This is supposed to be for reviews of the Book of Thoth, not the regular Conan serie.

So, having cleared that, I must say that this is one of the most true to Howard's vision comic book stories ever; from the rich narrative to the magnificent images & the surprising conclusion (at least fro Thoth-Amon who had quite a shock from the reward he was expecting) The Kelley Jones art is magnificent (but I miss John Beatty's inking) and it fits the story well. All in all a great book for Conan fans, which can be appreciated by comic book readers or diehard book fans. </s>"
26,An authentic story of Robert's journey to self actualization and inner peace </s>,"summarize: Robert DeLaurentis bares all in his writing of his journey from someone operating in the world without concern for how he treated others leaving a trail of emotional and spiritual carnage behind him to a loving self actualized spiritual being having a human experience. With the understanding, skills and compassion that goes with it. This is the story of Robert's journey to finding inner peace, becoming a man of integrity, living a life being of service to others. Looking forward to Zen Pilot when it comes out. </s>"
27,"Good macabre fun for the discerning... go slumming, vicariously! </s>","summarize: I like this book, for the most part, and as a former resident of La La Land in the makeup and FX field, it tickled me. Mostly. The mixed emotions engendered are like those of one watching THE LOVED ONE for the first time. Sick humor. It gets you in the discomfort zone, where sham religion meets an industry based on formaldehyde and flowers. At its best, there's a whimsical black humor; at it's worst, it's like the obsessive train-wreck watching and ghoulishness found in HOLLYWOOD BABYLON.
I plan to take a tour. This book will rest alongside THE GHOUL'S GUIDE TO LOS ANGELES. </s>"
28,"Amazing, beautifully written, totally in love with Callie nd Kayden!!!! </s>","summarize: Rarely does one get so invested in a storyline just like Callie and Kayden's but from Chapter one, I am reeled in and boy, did I sink to the bottom!!!! This story of survival, of friendships and love found amidst tragedy, just resonates so clearly that I am left in tears and awe! Jessica Sorensen is a truly gifted writer and I thank you for bringing us on such highs and lows with every book you write!!! </s>"
29,Beauty and the beast a portrait of love never knew of this comic books existed </s>,"summarize: Beauty and the beast a portrait of love
never knew of this comic books existed. . it captures some of the magic of the series... the words that stir the soul in there utterances and reciting... emil said the music for the series should have got an oscar... i think its the writing that should have had the awards... the comic book shows the glory of the writing. </s>"
30,"Awful, terrible, gross, disgusting, bad- Pick one word and that's this book </s>","summarize: Awful, AWFUL novel. The H is an insufferable lout. The h is dumb and manipulative. None of the characters were fully fleshed out. There is no romance, I can't think of anything remotely romantic that happened in this novel. Oh my god, so many things were wrong with this novel. Don't waste your money. </s>"
31,As honest of a look at Christian theology and church practice as it gets </s>,"summarize: Driscoll's way of thinking is not going to sit well with everyone, but he unashamedly puts forth his view of Christian theology and church practice which is why I enjoy his work. He knows that no matter how you talk about theological issues you are going to offend somebody, so he embraces that fact and sticks to brutal honesty. His humor is also not going to be everyone's cup of tea, but try to harden your skin a little bit and give it a try. It will be worth your time. </s>"
32,Nothing to Envy:  Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick </s>,"summarize: Nothing to Envy is a real life account of life in North Korea after the Korean War.  I found it very interesting because I knew very little about North Korea and this is a story about several families and how they coped with fear, starvation and eventual escape to freedom.  There were parts that were difficult for me to read due to the content and hard to imagine that these things happened to real people.  I highly recommend this book. </s>"
33,"Contributing to the conversation we need to have, weak solutions </s>","summarize: Daria Roithmaryr is saying a lot of important things that we should be thinking about. She may not have all of the correct analyses or the right solutions but she has many good ones and she is contributing a great deal to the conversation that we need to have. Her solutions are not well developed and don't make much sense. This unfortunately is typical for this type of book. We have not figured out what to do about injustice, racial or economic.

Midwest Independent Research, educational websites.  Race, mwir-race.blogspot  There are book lists here. </s>"
34,"... Bidinotto kept us waiting for this sequel to his great novel ""Hunter"" but it was well worth the wait </s>","summarize: Mr Bidinotto kept us waiting for this sequel to his great novel ""Hunter"" but it was well worth the wait !! Great pacing and well developed characters. This time instead of continuous action like ""Hunter"" he paced it so it reached a crescendo--I enjoyed both novels and can't say which style I preferred, both were equally good.  Then just when you thought the action was done he left us wondering what is going to happen next !! A thoroughly  engrossing fast paced novel. Write faster Robert I want the next book soon !! </s>"
35,Very well written documentary that weaves together several lives around the Chicago exposition </s>,"summarize: Something for everyone. A serial killer on the loose, major architects, corrupt politicians, a historical portrait of a moment in time, a snapshot of old Chicago... it is a great read and does not really dwell on Holmes but brings in his story to provide purient interest which keeps the book moving along. Highly recommended. </s>"
36,You need fewer negatives and far more positives. Too bogged down. </s>,"summarize: The story is a great idea, but you have the same consuming problem of so many writers making the bad guys very capable and the good guys can't do squat. Here is this kid who is supposed to do miraculous things and he does't do anything to make this possible. Where is there any evidence that Wil  has any poweres? He has been kidnapped and nearly killed making everyone around him  look like buffoons. </s>"
37,"This is a wonderful dictionary with plenty of definitions, illustrations and ""our living language"" notes too. </s>","summarize: This is a wonderful dictionary with plenty of definitions, illustrations and ""our living language"" notes too.  Also, the word ""gullible"" is on page 782 on the right hand column.

Perhaps the other reviewer did not look carefully for his random word of choice to make a one-star review!  Perhaps a better word choice for him is ""diligent""; which appears on page 507. </s>"
38,The author has a wonderful gift of bringing you into yourself </s>,"summarize: I would strongly suggest this book and its counterpart, the power of a praying wife, to any newly Wed couple as well as a couple that has been married for years. Taking the time out of your day to pray for your husband or wife, makes a huge difference in your relationship. The author has a wonderful gift of bringing you into yourself, helping you meditate on your prayer, and to devote an easy amount of time each day to making a difference in your relationship. </s>"
39,Refreshing look at how to get out of the financial mess we often create for ouselves </s>,"summarize: It is refreshing to read a book about money that doesn't just give the usual list of things to do - that in honesty we aren't gonna do anyway. This book helps us understand the financial madness many of us create for ourselves, and then gives us new ways of looking at it. To use the language of the book 'get out of the financial prisons we have created'. </s>"
40,"Very good, but lacking compared with the others in the series </s>","summarize: I found this book enjoyable to read, but it lacked the ""punch"" the other books in the series had.  It was difficult for me to constantly have to try and wrap my tongue around the heroine's name, Xiao Fei.  Otherwise it was good.  I'm still looking forward to the next and final installment, ""Crimson Rogue."" </s>"
41,"Nothing New, But the Chronological Order of Events is Helpful </s>","summarize: Much of what was covered in the book has been addressed previously in the media. I did like the way the information was presented chronologically. Having Trump in office has been exhausting due to the level of chaos within his administration (much, of his own doing) that is reported on daily, but I had forgotten about some of his earlier escapades. I have to agree with the many comments that say the book is poorly written. </s>"
42,Purchased this book because I like to know more about photoshop </s>,"summarize: Purchased this book because I like to know more about photoshop. Its the photo editing software that I'm interested to do at the moment and I am gathering information about it before the actual editing takes place, and I like the information I've read in this book. Specifically on photo retouching and image enhancing. Its a good book for a newbie like me and the text are readable. Good book in my opinion! </s>"
43,"Enjoy the selection of traditional carols, and appreciate the simplicity. </s>","summarize: I love it---with a caveat: I've sung in a choir and our choir director enjoyed singing more unusual traditional music.  No ""Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer"" here.  As a lover of Christmas music and an appreciator of the traditional - less often heard music, I'm thrilled.  As a recent adopter of the uke, I appreciate the two chord simpler arrangements---although I have to admit there are a few chords I've never played before.

Large format printing, check.  Lie-flat binding, check.  Good value, also.  Glad I bought it. </s>"
44,Shows the emotional growth of Meagan after being the victim of horrifying crime </s>,"summarize: Meagan was on the path of success at a prestigious law firm at a young age.  On the tract of partner then segue into is successful political career.  Then she was beaten and raped.  She loses almost everything and learns some hard lessons about life.
A very good read.  Twists and turns along the way. </s>"
45,This book is a good guide to learn and understand about recycling </s>,summarize: This book is a good guide to learn and understand about recycling! I learn different tips and ideas on how to make crafts using recycle materials. This book is very interesting. I will share this book to my friends. The books gives me easy to follow instruction so I can start anytime making crafts. Thanks! </s>
46,Couldnt get past first couple of chapters. The Big Bad is a a disappointment. </s>,summarize: I liked the first in the series well enough. But this one I just couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. The Big Bad was a pussy cat - where's the fun in that? He almost sounded stupid - which I don't find appealing at all. So I stopped reading it & have no desire to go back. Very disappointing. </s>
47,""" I would have preferred the someone was happy somewhere in the city </s>","summarize: I was intrigued by this novel, although the characters all seem bordering on hysteria.  They seem to over react to every situation.  I have recently read a couple of histories of Amsterdam, I found this a bit contradictory for the ""most liberal city in the world.""  I would have preferred the someone was happy somewhere in the city.  Was it under moral siege as Florence was under Savonarola?  (alert!)  The ending is not very satisfying since we never really find out about  the miniaturist and what she was about.  I'm not sure this author knows what she is writing about. </s>"
48,a plodding progression from bad to worse in a manner that is entertaining </s>,"summarize: The work is meant to be a bit oppressive to the reader, akin to some of the works of Hardy.  It is well written, a plodding progression from bad to worse in a manner that is entertaining, if not a bit difficult for my reading to press on.  The book may be less light-hearted than many would chose to consider reading.  I do believe that, while being hardly up to the ability to create such a work, it might have been perhaps edited a bit more tightly to improve its pacing.  To my taste, poor though it might be, the book plods along at times, needlessly slowly. </s>"
49,The story is silly and immature but that's what kids love. My son has rad the entire series already </s>,summarize: Our 4 yo really loves reading this series and has read it several times and even brought it to school to share and trade with class mates. Any book that makes our kids read on their own is worth the price of admission. The story is silly and immature but that's what kids love. My son has rad the entire series already. </s>
50,Reading another one of Miss Prentice's adventures is like returning to a favorite vacation spot </s>,summarize: Reading another one of Miss Prentice's adventures is like returning to a favorite vacation spot. You settle in quickly among staff who are more like old friends and catch up on the latest news/gossip --- just in time to land smack in the middle of another mystery accompanied with enough danger to keep you rushing to the safety at the end of your trip. Incomplete Sentence certainly delivered the high standards set from the beginning. I'll be packed and ready for the next visit as soon as the reservations open. </s>
51,This book gave my inner child a chance to run free for a few hours! </s>,"summarize: A great beach read. This is the first in a series and was thoroughly enjoyable sci-fi space opera. Ferocious alien bugs. Friendly alien humanoids. Mysterious villains in the background. Convoluted politics. Fun technology.  Woo hoo!
Unfortunately, the series ends with a thud. The next two are good books but the final installment ran off the rails. </s>"
52,... reviews very often but this is one of the best books I have read this year </s>,"summarize: I don't leave reviews very often but this is one of the best books I have read this year. It was funny, Romantic with just enough violence to keep things interesting. I didn't get bored which can happen with longer books. I highly recommended this book for anytime read! I will be reading it over and over. </s>"
53,This is a particularly desirable edition of The New Good Housekeeping Cookbook. </s>,"summarize: I was so happy to find this particular edition of The New Good Housekeeping Cookbook;  My husband gave me a copy of this book when we were married and I wanted a copy of it for my daughter.  It has recipes for just about anything one could think to cook, but the particular reason I wanted this edition, was because it explains to the novice HOW TO COOK and HOW TO deal with each category of food, for example, how to choose fruit or certain cuts of meat.  Of course, one may need to adapt recipes to a healthier mode, but that's easily enough to do.  This book is a real ""find."" </s>"
54,Does he deserve to be rated as one of the worst Presidents? Read this and see </s>,"summarize: This book gave a very complete telling of his life. It also changed my viewpoint of Mr Buchanan from ""that loser that got us into the Civil War"". I think it is fair to say that his reputation was so successfully besmirched by Party of Lincoln that it never will recover. Does he deserve to be rated as one of the worst Presidents? Read this and see. </s>"
55,Interesting book with a lot of great commentary on current and past world issues </s>,"summarize: Interesting book with a lot of great commentary on current and past world issues, how the times have changed and how to evolve with them. It also discusses some other information that some would find really interesting such as ""Why to be a B corp"" , ""The Five Steps to Starting Your Own Social Enterprise"", and ""The Power of Patience"". Overall, even as a non-economics major and someone who reads often but not generally on such a pointed topic I truly enjoyed this book and have recommenced it to a couple friends in the early stages of their business and even to established ones. </s>"
56,Terrific plotting that takes us into the heart of our American and Brit times </s>,"summarize: Jack Parlabane, where are you when we need you? Brookmyre's sleuth reporter has the guts, the connections and the persistence to break into the corporate/government/military web in which we all live - as flies to the spiders. This recent incident: [...]  - in which the co-owner of an American newspaper and five companions died in a fiery crash is just the sort of event that would send Parlabane on the hunt. In addition, to high believability, Brookmyre's writing is Scots-witty. I'm launched on reading all his books. </s>"
57,... read about a young African male that achieved some pretty spectacular scientific results without a formal education </s>,summarize: It was interesting to read about a young African male that achieved some pretty spectacular scientific results without a formal education.  The difficulty I had was the use of the native language and names and at times the story got bogged down in too many minute details regarding the scientific endeavors. </s>
58,"Like she is sitting next to you, teaching you every step of the way. </s>","summarize: I love Claudia Nice books, so much attention to detail, so simple and easy to follow, and really down-to-earth explainations. Her work is absolutely beautiful. Great book for the novice and advanced artists. All books that I've ordered on Amazon.com have been quality and extremely helpful in my advancement from novice to advanced artist. I highly recommend this book. </s>"
59,I love the detail that Jacqueline Winspear fills her books with </s>,"summarize: I love the detail that Jacqueline Winspear fills her books with.  I thought the letters about Tom's dinners were wonderful. I enjoyed the entire book, read it through in one sitting -- but I did find the ending a bit too much.  I love Maisie Dobbs and I liked this and I will read anything Jacqueline Winspear writes.  She's a wonderful (brilliant!) author. </s>"
60,This authors story has made me realize that I probably would have been very fortunate to have made it </s>,"summarize: I wanted to be a fighter pilot but did not have a college education when I went into the Air Force. This authors story has made me realize that I probably would have been very fortunate to have made it. Or I would be a casualty now.  There were few boring times in his life but his experience in combat was a real eye opener as to what is required of a person to become one.  The constant pressure of missions , one after the other, must have been such that only the best warrior could handle it. Great book! </s>"
61,All of Ruth Rendell/Barbara Vine's books are good and I like them all. </s>,"summarize: Her books have complicated characters and a story line you can ""sink your teeth into"".  This one speaks of society's attitudes toward illegitimcy and homosexuality and how they are changing.  Barbara Vine is my favorite author.  I believe I have read and liked all her books.  I like ""Anna's Book"" the best but there are so many.  Because she has written so many great books, I only gave this one four stars but I suppose it really deserves a five. </s>"
62,I throughly enjoyed Lou Ann Noble's fun character-driven story </s>,"summarize: I throughly enjoyed Lou Ann Noble's fun character-driven story, focusing on a turn of events and the consequences of one's actions. The plot in this book is intriguing and had me guessing for a while, which I love, and as far as action, it arrives in no time at all. Noble's strong voice, imagination, and writing style truly gives credence to her story. I will definitely be looking for more books by this author and encourage other readers to give her a try. </s>"
63,"If you are a pilot, especially a combat pilot, you will love this book. </s>",summarize: The story of a Minnesota farm boy who learned to fly and did some barnstorming. Before the USA entered WWII he felt the need to help England. He joined the RAF and became a fighter pilot. This is his story till the USA entered the war.

64,"Sorry, Nick. Shallow characters most of whom died; hard to understand premise; not persuasive. </s>","summarize: Why did the public succumb to hibernation? What happened to everyone else? Sounds like the Third World survived, so what motivated the First Worlders? What was the point of reading their minds or even influencing them? What did anyone get out of this whole convoluted system? Who did Nathan kill? What was the stone-thing? Where did come from? Why? What did it have to do with the hibernation chips? Questions, questions, questions. The preceding are only the beginning. </s>"
65,Found out I had a Melatonin deficiency. Of course Amazon had a book for me. </s>,summarize: This was a good book.  It was filled with a lot of information.  One of those books I will keep around for a reference.  I had never heard of a melatonin deficiency until I found out I had one.  I was very thankful that Amazon had a resource for me to find out exactly what melatonin does for the body. </s>
66,"Enjoyable read with some changes from the usual formula, but still another cop potential boyfriend. </s>","summarize: Very good mystery. Of course, the potential love interest is still ANOTHER cop, which has gotten very old. The best friend is fun and funny. There are lots of red herrings, good because the heroine lives on a boat. The series, that I imagine follows this, should be worth reading also. There were only a very few typos or misused words. </s>"
67,Great Sci-Fi with more than a touch of realistic family dynamics </s>,summarize: A well written post apocalyptic story of a world of sand built over the lost cities of our present age.  Artifacts are recovered by sand divers who use technology to control the sand as they dive.  The story revolves around a family with a talent for diving and the family struggles that affect all families to one degree or another. </s>
68,"If you love Georgette Heyer and Patricia C Wrede, you'll love this. </s>","summarize: In general, an excellent read. The characters are interesting and consistent throughout, as is the background. The use of period or variant language is likewise consistent. The magic system is interesting, the plot is twisty, the ending deeply satisfactory, with just a hint of ""to be continued"". There are a couple of places in the middle where the multiple flashback story framework and the related repeated cliffhangers got a bit predictable and tedious, but keep going, the story is worth it. As usual with Ms. Walsh, I find myself very much looking forward to more. </s>"
69,"A good middle school read, covering a post-apocalyptic situation in the western suburbs of Chicago. </s>","summarize: The book did meet my expectations, but it also left many questions unanswered. I gave the book to a young friend of the family, a thirteen year old girl, who has been reading the Hunger Games, and Divergent series. She enjoyed the book but said it was almost too tame and not a very deep read. I admit the short page count, but after-all, it was a standard mass market paperback, not a 600 page mega novel. I still liked the book, and it was set in my neck of the woods (Du Page County/Glen Ellyn). I'm just sorry that the author never continued the series. It might have tied up some loose ends. </s>"
70,Laughed my way through this walk through the life in the 1950+ </s>,"summarize: This book was chosen by one of our book club buddies who was looking for a book about the past with all the crazy  things that happened . It was well written with the way things happened. It was ""fun"" and classic things that kids ""thought  they could get away with but got caught"". The kind of stuff that we heard about at ""Class Reunions "" . </s>"
71,"Gorgeous vampire heroes, nasty baddies and brave feisty heroines </s>","summarize: Gorgeous vampire heroes, nasty baddies and brave feisty heroines, just what the doctor ordered. Mix in some mystical psychic gifts, and the world Ms Kreig is intriguing, steamy, full of action, suspense and ancient enemies. Carefully crafted, this story might not be the most original story in the supernatural genre, but it does exactly what it's meant to do, provide an enjoyable, entertaining read. </s>"

75,Wunderkeys is a FANTASTIC method to introduce preschoolers to music </s>,"summarize: Wunderkeys is a FANTASTIC method to introduce preschoolers to music.  It truly does give them a head start in music and math.  The pages are full of color and appealing to look at.  The activities are simple, engaging, and fun.  The at-home parent guide is easy to follow even for non-musical parents.  The cartoon characters are fun and relatable.  Trevor and Andrea Dow are piano GENIUSES.  As a piano teacher, the make my life ever so much easier. </s>"
76,"... would describe Farmer in the Sky as a very good novel, even though it's rather short </s>","summarize: I would describe Farmer in the Sky as a very good novel, even though it's short. I also wouldn't bother getting it in hardcover or library binding... Amazingly enough, the explanations for the technology are still current, even though the book was written 7 years before the first satellite was ever launched into space - Heinlein even included the importance of keeping mass to a minimum, as well as the plastic bags for eating and drinking out of in space. The paperback has a few pages at the end about the circumstances surrounding the writing of the book, if you're into that kind of thing. </s>"
77,"Inspirational, Heartbreaking, Heart-Stopping, Hilarious and Loving </s>","summarize: Beyond inspiring and heart renewing. You never know the footsteps of a complete stranger, yet reading this very ""up close and personal testimony,"" allowed me a seat in the living room of ""Big Lou's,"" antics, Lou's love for her mother, children and family. We know her as Pastor Lucille O'Neal; a sweetheart. </s>"
78,If you know a child or coworker or loved one with Asperger's or OCD </s>,"summarize: Phenomenal! This story is truly special. Pla's writing allows you to crawl inside the main character's head and see the world how Charlie sees it. If you have Asperger's or OCD, you'll see yourself reflected in these pages. If you know a child or coworker or loved one with Asperger's or OCD, this book will help you gain a new understanding of their everyday trials and victories. Pla captured so much in these pages. I could've spent forever with these characters. You definitely want this book on your must read list! </s>"

80,I have read every book by Charlotte Roth and enjoyed them all </s>,"summarize: I have read every book by Charlotte Roth and enjoyed them all. This book is no exception: a real page turner and a very interesting subject - what is a perfect life, how do you create a perfect world?And at which expenses?
Its also a heart wrenching description of infertility - and a touching story about love - between siblings, mothers and daughters, and husband and wives. It made me sob a few times and it made me stay up way too late to finish another chapter. A good, entertaining read. </s>"
81,"If there is a more important and powerful book out there, I haven't found it. </s>","summarize: Better than anyone I've ever read or heard, Hartmann explains the cultural and environmental crises we have wrought, how we got there, and what we can do to overcome them. It is full of factual evidence and well-thought-out insights.
Hartmann is a brilliant and prolific writer as well as an Air America radio host. If everyone would read it, there would be a lot more hope for our future. </s>"
82,The trials encountered while coming of age as a Naval Officer. </s>,"summarize: The author reveals much of the difficulties Naval Officers must endure while transiting the troubled waters as an Ensign. There is good humor here mixed with a rather good account of the hazards and difficulties a junior officer must surmount if his career is to survive, let alone prosper. The author writes well and the story-line keeps you turning pages. A good read. Highly recommended. </s>"
83,... flow of the book and the stories make learning fun and engaging </s>,"summarize: The flow of the book and the stories make learning fun and engaging. I like how the author includes definitions of specific phrases along with the story. The structure of the stories adds a twist to the basic English-French translation dictionaries. The stories are centered on everyday life and I catch myself speaking random phrases throughout the day. Very useful for my beginners after they get their feet wet with some grammar. That being said, it is very useful once they know pronunciation. They can get the meaning of the story without knowing every single word. </s>"
84,Author's attempt to make this read like an investigation written in 1910 or so </s>,"summarize: Author's attempt to make this read like an investigation written in 1910 or so, gets in the way of the story. Her essays on claimed methodology of the investigation are best skimmed over.

It does appear as if Oates is attempting to demonstrate her supple skill at writing different styles in the same novel. The essays are hardly persuasive. </s>"
85,This is a fairy tale of a childless couple who sculpt a snow girl who becomes real. </s>,summarize: This is a fairy tale of a childless couple who build a snow girl who becomes real. The reader follows the sadness of their isolated  become more fulfilling with the advent of the snow child. It is not a great book but rather an interesting quick read time filler. The characters are well described and  hold the attention of the reader </s>
86,Indispensable Guide.  Cannot imagine why you would not buying this. </s>,"summarize: This is a wonderful book, and is making all the difference in my understanding and using the features on my new camera.  I can hardly wait for the next edition to cover some of the extra features of DSC-RX100 III.  I cannot imagine trying to understand this sophisticated camera with the awful users manual that Sony provides.  I have previously been a Canon fan, so I wanted to learn all of the sophisticated new features, as well as the Sony basics. </s>"
87,"Historical romance is normally not my most favorite genre, but this was fun to read </s>","summarize: Amusing and light read. Historical romance is normally not my most favorite genre, but this was fun to read. When it became a bit boring a new twist was introduced.  I'm reading right now the second book of this series, but I think that is it because the main theme repeats itself. Nevertheless, it's like with the first book, when it becomes boring, a new twist is introduced. The writer is talented and good at this genre. </s>"
88,"Nice gift that may get you back in her good graces....hah, on second thought just send it anonomyously </s>","summarize: Tamsen's book makes a great gift for the women you have pissed-off so badly they will likely never speak to you again.  The book will make her smile and she wlil think fondly of you .....for about 20 seconds but without the book she would hunt ya down and cut your nuts off.
Give her/then the book and some flowers and some candy and some wine and some cash and a fur coat and you may....i repeat....may get forgiven.  But wit hthe book, the ladies can do oh, so much better than you (us). </s>"
89,I'll never read another of her novels or recommend them. The first ones where good </s>,"summarize: I used to be a huge fan.  There are no words for how awful her story lines and writing have become.  Page after page of uninteresting self important drivel.  There used to be action and excitement in her novels.  That has all been replaced by the main character's self indulgent obsessing over who she is going to have sex with that night and why she just HAS to.  Nauseating.  I'll never read another of her novels or recommend them.  The first ones where good, but what's the point when the story devolves into this?? </s>"
90,Another very entertaining instalment of a great mystery series! </s>,"summarize: With Family is Murder, Carolyn Arnold has created the fifth instalment of the McKinley Mysteries series. I did only read the fourth instalment before  I am going to read instalments 1-3, soon. It is not necessary to have read the previous instalments before; you get to know Sara and Sean quickly. You certainly want to read them, though. Family is Murder offers food for thought with a thrill, being an entertaining and fast read, making you want to read more.

This is a book to read again. </s>"
91,Waiting for Strand and Konrath to do a follow up to this one! </s>,"summarize: Konrath and Strand HAVE to do another book combining these characters again!  You have to read this book, it is AWESOME. Great story, and the best parts the dry humor talents of Jeff Strand and JA Konrath (two of my favorites).  Also, if you haven't read their other books, do so as fast as you can, they are all GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!  If you love gore, sick humor and fantastic characters, these are the authors for you. Get the Jack Daniels series of books by Konrath and the Andrew Mayhem series from Strand, THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </s>"
92,"Most Excellent Bible Story Book-Reliably accurate, and so well done! </s>","summarize: I have purchased many, many children's Bibles or Bible story Books.  This one tops them all!  Even grown-ups love to read these stories, as every single one explains perfectly how these stories throughout the Old and New Testament all point to Jesus.  It brings the whole Bible into proper perspective, and the kids cant seem to get enough of it.  Best purchase ever! </s>"
93,"A good book, if you are just curious about how finance and physics can intersect. </s>","summarize: An interesting take on the life of a physicist who sells out and uses his powers for evil. Just kidding. As a physicist myself, who topped out at a bachelor's degree, I can't blame anyone who got tired solving Schroedinger's equation over and over again to go into a field that offers not only different math but better pay. </s>"
94,"Tap the helmets & put on the body armor. We gotta' disarm this bomb before...well, you know! </s>","summarize: Robert Crais is a diverse writer -re: the Elvis Cole & Joe Pike novels, etc. In this novel the author writes about Carol Starkey, the LAPD bomb tech who gets blown up, dies (momentarily), and is resuscitated, and then goes on to head up the investigation team into the death of a colleague and to deactivate the notorious ""Mr. Red"", a psychopath with an explosive agenda. An excellent book. </s>"
95,A rare visual design book that offers truly useful information. </s>,"summarize: White has been giving great design advice for many years and once again he has written a book I can recommend to my visual design students with confidence.

Even though he comes from a previous design generation, much of his astute commentary is still valid in midst  of the current revolution of cognition-based design.

White's vocabulary is different to that  used in 21st century cognition-based design instruction, but many of his concepts are validated by modern fundamentals.

I recommend this book highly. </s>"
96,Book three is filled with adventures that you would never imagine. </s>,"summarize: You will not be disappointed. Rather, left at the conclusion wanting more!  This book will take you captive and reimmerse you into the intimate lives of its characters. You will undoubtedly find your own pulse and respirations to mirror those of the characters within as you deftly turn each page with anticipation. All of your emotions will become ignited as only Diana Gabaldon can illicit as she cleverly lures you to drink in every word...... </s>"
97,A major distraction in reading is the poor grammar (same errors repeated throughout the book) </s>,"summarize: This gets three stars for a fair plot, and even though I finished it, I would not continue with the series.  It has huge holes in it for the Regency genre and was implausible in several areas.  A major distraction in reading is the poor grammar (same errors repeated throughout the book), i.e., you instead of your, an instead of a, scone when they mean sconce. </s>"
98,My third Hobbit edition to add to my collection and I love it! </s>,"summarize: Small and good quality, but not so nice that I want to leave it on a shelf and never read it. I bought this to be the version to read to my kids once they are old enough. I have an annotated version, which is great but not so much for story time and the green hardback version that is too nice when you have little goobers going to put their little grubbies on the pages. :) This will be great, now if only their attention span would grow quicker so I can read it to them. :) </s>"
99,I've read all Doyle's stories many times but enjoy the artwork in this edition </s>,"summarize: I've read all Doyle's stories many times but enjoy the artwork in this edition.  Another I've liked, w/ Pagetesqe drawings is here:

100,Church vs. Education and the importance of God in our schhols </s>,"summarize: This was a fabulous book with themes from racism, religious freedom, and faithfulness of God. I challenge any Christian to read this book, especially those teachers in public school. It was one of best Church vs. State books I have read. If you enjoyed the new God's not Dead 2, this should be your next read. </s>"
101,"Not a Scenic hikes book.....please use Google Image search before doing these so called ""hikes"" </s>","summarize: Thank goodness for google image search and we can see which of these hikes are actually scenic and not have to suffer Sullivan's folly.....Out of the 100 ""hikes"" there's barely a dozen that are scenic, the rest are walks to various non nondescript fishing holes or historic cabins such as the Sterling Ditch Tunnel or Sucker Creek......that is so ironic...""Sucker Lake""  has anyone been dumb enough to go to Sucker Lake?  Please do a google image search on these hikes before wasting your time </s>"
102,We read it about two-three times and he was able to start reciting it back to us. </s>,summarize: Our five year old son loves this book. We read it about two-three times and he was able to start reciting it back to us. It cracks up all the time when we read this book. The pictures entertain him as well. He is able to point out each of the animals. Our copy is a paperback edition found at our local thrift store. </s>
103,Marcus J. Borg ... a Biblical Theologian for the Church of Jesus Christ in the 21st Century </s>,"summarize: His ""historical-metaphorical"" method of examining the Jewish and Christian scriptures takes deeply experienced religious faith seriously as a handmaiden of rigorously critical intellectual examination of origins, functions, contexts, and authorship of those texts.
A must read for every ""thinking"" believer. </s>"
104,WE are a popcorn family...so this is a treat even before we get started! </s>,"summarize: We are a popcorn family. We have pounds and pounds of popcorn in our
freezer as I write this.
I bookmarked several of the recipes today, so that we can try those first.

I like how they've included nutritional info on each recipe, but the one
thing they didn't include (that I wished they had) was a little one or two
sentence summary about the recipe, and what to expect taste-wise.

That, to me was the only negative.
Otherwise...a bunch of good recipes, both sweet and savory, for the popcorn
lover in your household. </s>"
105,From the foothills of the Himalayas to Morocco and London another globe trotting thriller from Jon Evans </s>,"summarize: A cracking pace, familiar, likeable characters with dollops of humour and real life.  There is a follow up novel, Blood Price which is equally as good and features the same characters.  His hero is just an ordinary guy who has been thrust into an extraordinary situation - no Jack Reacher, just an average guy trying to survive and do what's right.  Read it, then read the rest of his novels, I haven't been disappointed. </s>"
106,Great book for both dog lovers and those who love a good ghost story!! </s>,summarize: I picked this book up in a local book shop and could not put it down! I got goosebumps after reading each story...but not the creepy kind. This is a heartwarming book especially for animal lovers. It goes to show that the power of our pets is something that goes beyond death. I would highly recommend this well-written and beautiful book. </s>
107,Alice in Wonderland is simply one of my favorite stories and movies </s>,"summarize: Alice in Wonderland is simply one of my favorite stories and movies. I go crazy over anything Alice! This book is absolutely stunning. The pictures are very detailed, and gorgeous. They're very classic, no off-brand designs you might find in a cheaper book. The pages are a nice thick quality, which made me think of the popular Joanna Basford books. I love this coloring book and almost can't bear to color in it! </s>"
108,I have read some wonderful historical novels set in Manhattan during this period </s>,"summarize: I was drawn to the book because it is set in late 19th century Manhattan. I have read some wonderful historical novels set in Manhattan during this period. With regard to this, the book was truly disappointing. I also found the characters lacking. It was a long winded read, predictable, and I felt that nothing was really happening. </s>"
109,A personal glimpse into the mind & nose of Jean-Claude Ellena </s>,"summarize: A quick read, I thoroughly enjoyed this book that does not so much explain the ""how"" as the ""why"" of Mr. Ellena's gift.  As I read this, I felt as if I was peeking into hand-written notes that he puts in his beloved Moleskine notebooks every few days.  If you're interested in his stream of conscience thoughts rather than analytical details of perfume construction (although there are interesting details of this as well) you will be delighted with this little book. </s>"
110,Promising entry into a world we don't know that much about yet. </s>,"summarize: More like 3.6 stars. Interesting entry into  a world we don't know that much about yet. A very fast read.  Some fairly big contrivances at the end of the book, but I am still looking forward to reading Book 2.  I wish the moral dilemmas and exactions by some of the characters were developed a bit more.  We get that the world is sort of 'survival of the fittest', but Humanity's loss of ""humanity"" is a bit under-developed in my opinion. </s>"
111,Get ready to do your own hard time figuring out the plot twist of this story! </s>,"summarize: After being released from prison, Jeff heads west where he meets Ariana, a publicist for the A list celebrities.  Ariana, focused on making a success of her business and containing damage control for one of her major stars finds herself attracted to the one person she should stay away from personally.  With plot twists, surprised family connections, and an unexpected villain, readers should be prepared to decide at what point Jeff did his hard time, is it in the past or in his present? </s>"
112,Juxtapose post WW-II with the early 21st Century in American foreign policy! </s>,"summarize: Historically intriguing. A must read for those who are interested in 20th-Century American history. Juxtapose this this against America's attitudes about foreign policy today and one will see an interesting trend toward renewed isolationism. Extremely well researched, documented, and well-written. The Dulles brothers are a unique and important chapter in American history. </s>"
113,... was my first book by Normandie Alleman and I enjoyed it - had a hard time putting it down </s>,"summarize: This was my first book by Normandie Alleman and I enjoyed it - had a hard time putting it down!  The story flowed very nicely and was super HOT!  Even though the majority of the book is with the main characters, Sophie and MC, communicating via text or Skype I thought it was intriguing.  I loved the challenges that MC set up for Sophie.  It has me wanting to read the next chapters in there adventure. </s>"
114,"Powerful, common-sense approach to writing fiction or non-fiction FAST! </s>","summarize: This is a common-sense, structured approach to writing a book that can work for fiction or non-fiction. It requires a lot of brain-work on the front end but results in a rapidly written book that I think would be much more cohesive overall. I plan on following this approach on my next fiction and non-fiction titles. I'll be sure to let you know the results I get, Rachel! </s>"
115,Amazing - you might nned oven mitts just to hold this book - Just that hot  Enjoy </s>,summarize: Do you enjoy a hot story about an alpha male and his love? Well you are in for a treat - no tricks this Halloween. Think the hottest thing you have read and double that- Yes two hot alpha Vikings  plus a time traveling nerd  makes for one amazing story. This is the perfect addition to the Viking wolves and 50 states series but you do not have to read the other books( but I strongly suggest you do- really great books ) to following the story but it helps to know all the players backstory. Did I mention how hot the story is??? </s>
116,I just ate up these honest and frank opinions from a man who spent his life with the women in the White House. </s>,"summarize: I really loved this book and felt Mr. West gave his life to these First Ladies, each so different from the others. He was discreet in his assessments, yet giving us a glimpse we could get from no one else. Many surprises, as weIl as information I hadn't guessed about each of these ladies. He was admirable in every way. </s>"
117,Professor Mee's text on Gravity is an excellent expose on this universal phenomenon </s>,"summarize: Professor Mee's text on Gravity is an excellent expose on this universal phenomenon, written in simple language that the layman can access and gain a good understanding of this universal phenomenon that keeps the universes together. This book may be of great help to the student who is about to embark on a course on astronomy. </s>"
118,Thakyou to all the contributors for so honestly revealing your less than perfect moments. </s>,"summarize: Lighthearted look at the ugly side of motherhood behaviour. There is sufficient variety in these short essays for any mother to be able to relate to the adult tantrums described. As with everything to do with parenthood, it is reassuring to find that you are not the only mother who doesn't have it all together all the time.

Thakyou to all the contributors for so honestly revealing your less than perfect moments. </s>"
119,... we were attacked on 9/11/01 wondering how on Gods good earth did an enemy infiltrate </s>,summarize: I have researched both political  parties since we were attacked on 9/11/01 wondering how on Gods good earth did an enemy infiltrate? The Democrat's have played around with our lives- that is why Trump won.

120,Daniel Boorstin is one of my favorite historians. I read his books in the 90s </s>,"summarize: Daniel Boorstin is one of my favorite historians.  I read his books in the 90s, and although I was well versed in world history, his clear writing style, and unique talent for making the connections between seemingly far flung events, personalities, and creations opened up a new way of thinking about our world and ways we interact with it. </s>"
121,All you wanted to know about Sahara's money..actually explained ! </s>,"summarize: Most cocktail conversations and B-school introspections are incomplete without the question "" how did Sahara make this kind of money"" being hotly debated. Here at last we have an decently researched book which actually answers this question in some detail. This has to be a must read book for anyone in the world of finance and banking. Given its topicality, its bound to be a hit in my opinion. </s>"
122,"Sensitive and needs parental discretion, but is a beautiful story </s>","summarize: This is very serious children's literature and should be checked out by parents first because it does cover very mature subjects including mental illness and death of a parent.  Chirp is so nicknamed because of her love for birds and nature.  Naomi is her real name.

The book tells a beautiful and sensitive story.  Chirp and her best friend, Joey (who also has issues) are very real characters and while this is an emotional story, it also contains a lot of humor.  The target audience will definitely identify with it.  I recommend this highly.  BTW, adults will get a lor out of it too. </s>"
123,"Once they learned power rested on their chest and between their legs, they used it. Daily. </s>","summarize: I quit reading this story as it bounces between the years.  The reader does not know what has, is, or might happen.

It has excellent statements such as when young women discover feminine power:

""Once they learned power rested on their chest and between their legs, they used it. Daily.""

I may start reading it again. </s>"

125,Must read before indulging the Lord of the Rings Triology books or movies </s>,"summarize: Wish I had read The Hobbit first before reading the Lord of the Rings triology books or watching the movies.
The Lord of the Rings triology books  and movies would have been so much easier to follow and appreciate.

The Kindle version of The Hobbit allowed me to zoom in on the maps and pictures (using the View Notes & Marks feature of the Kindle), easily toggling back and forth from where I was reading along in the book.  I was surprised how easy it was using the Kindle book version...easier than trying to flip back and forth using a paper back book version. </s>"
126,You gotta read this ... The Miracle Equation is a money maker! </s>,"summarize: The Miracle Equation is one of my favorite parts of this book.  This principle has helped me create millions of dollars in sales in my own personal business!

128,Winner Take All (previously published as Rain Storm/Choke Point) </s>,"summarize: Well, I'm enjoying one per month of this series in the order they were published taking advantage of the prime lending library.  If you have a kindle and don't yet have a prime account...get one! A free book every month movies like netflix and free shipping an most amazon orders....what are you waiting for??  Barry Eisler really tells a great story and in this book, we get a further look at the humanity of John Rain, the protagonist in this wonderful series. </s>"
129,Enjoyable first hand history by a sailor who served in the Pacific throughout World War II. </s>,"summarize: Enjoyable first hand history by a person who joined the Navy before Pearl Harbor and served in the Pacific throughout WWII.  He missed being at Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7 1941 due to an accident; he served on the USS Northampton in several major battles including the Doolittle raid on Tokyo and the Battle of Santa Cruz, culminating in the loss of the Northampton at the Battle of Tassafaronga, off Guadalcanal.  He then served in a repair ship, followed by service in a destroyer.  As a note of warning: The language is authentic, with four letter words sprinkled liberally throughout. </s>"
130,"Find a comfy spot, cause you won't want to stop reading this! </s>","summarize: This was my fun read for the week and I really enjoyed the book.  It was fast paced and packed with characters I immediately wanted to get to know better.  I felt an instant emotional connection to Camille, the main character.  She was witty, strong, and trying to find her way. (My kinda gal) I thought Edwards did a great job of developing the emotional connection between her heroine and the hero, Julian.  It was one of those stories that I read until I just couldn't keep my eyes open!  Then I woke up early before work and finished it the next morning!  C. Johnston a.k.a. Krystal Shannan </s>"
131,"What a fabulous collection - best of all, I haven't read any of them before! </s>",summarize: Wow! What a wonderful collection by some of my favourite authors. Most of the stories are brilliant with mysteries galore and the reappearance of my favourite characters.  Some of the stories are by authors that I haven't read before. What a terrific bargain that gives you a taster of some great paranormal cozy mystery writers. Grab a bargain and enjoy! </s>
132,"Many diamonds in the rough, a rollicking read! 5/5 from a collector of this series. </s>","summarize: Dozois's editing has again produced a huge volume of short story science fiction literature, and some of these shine like absolute beacons in the night. Unfortunately the sparkling ones do tend to contrast highly against the few which are somewhat dull. However, for those familiar with, and with a liking for these yearly collections, it is a must-read. </s>"
133,Emotional and Heated - A Great Romance with Strong Characters </s>,"summarize: Emotional, steamy, and exciting, this story is incredibly hard to put down. I immediately felt for Hero and Arturo and their sorrow. It's a touching story as these two fight to be open to love once again. The writing is flawless and characters spot on. I truly felt their pain, which speaks to the talent if the author. The characters flesh out beautifully and I came to care for them so much. An awesome read I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend. This is a voluntary review of an advance reader copy. </s>"
134,A great book with all of the feels!  Another hit for Summer Cooper! </s>,summarize: I really enjoyed reading Nina and Griffin's story.  There are a lot of great moments in there - some of all the feels!  The character of Kenny is hilarious and I think he needs his own story with his bf. What a truly great book to read.  I definitely recommend this one.  I read this book as an ARC and this is my honest review. </s>
135,The price of the set is worth it for even just one of the stories. </s>,"summarize: I received an ARC for Sleeping with the Enemy by Tia Siren and for just that one story alone it's worth the cost of the set.  The story has a blend of mystery, intrigue, suspense along with some intense chemistry between two characters brought together  by the death of a brother/employee.  It's a quick and easy read with some very sexy scenes but also some heartfelt ones as well.  Haven't read any of the other stories in the set, but again this one alone makes the $.99 cost worth it.  I am voluntarily leaving a review. </s>"
136,You'll probably want to take a Intermediate to Advanced French Class before reading this book! </s>,"summarize: I tried to read this book, but I felt like I needed to interpret the French language better to be able to get through it. There was just too much French language without the usual English interpretation with it, as you see other authors thoughtfully do. I am an avid reader of Christian Historical Fiction and I understand French some, but it was just too much. The cover was beautiful and initially drew me to the book, but hence the saying goes and reversely applies to this book....""you can't judge a book by it's cover."" </s>"
137,When I saw the previews of the upcoming movie I thought perhaps the movie might be better then the book </s>,"summarize: For a book it was okay. The ending was some what of a let down, happened to fast. Although Rachel figured out what was going on between the deceased the and culprit there was no/know coherence. That may be the wrong usage of the word. When I saw the previews of the upcoming movie I thought perhaps the movie might be better then the book. But now I do not think so. </s>"
138,"Fast read, excellent description and couldn't put down! So brave! </s>","summarize: Having read up a lot on Scientology due to friends previous involvement, this is the most compelling story. Candid, honest and helps you understand how people get and stay trapped by this cult. Super impressed by the Headley's and their willingness to speak out at great personal cost to help others leave or even avoid this trap altogether! </s>"
139,The characters in this book were so dysfunctional that it was delicious! </s>,"summarize: The characters in this book were so dysfunctional that it was delicious!  I should feel some amount of tangible guilt for enjoying their bad choices, humiliations and familial disasters, but I do not.  Basically, the book is sort of like reality tv, which happens to be a big theme floating through the plot, where the reader knows it going to implode, but we keep reading to see the much anticipated implosion.  Glad I took a chance on this book, it was worth the read. </s>"
140,The Dog Catcher will catch & keep your attention!  Great read!! </s>,"summarize: The Dog Catcher by Lloyd Johnson was a page turner.  It was hard for me to put this book down.  I love that the story gives background from her early childhood, her parent's relationship, her issues with self and relationship; it address homosexuality, abusive relationships, mental instabilities, and a host of other issues.  Cheryl's issues can and are those of many ladies today.  I love the twists, the turns, the letdowns and the wins.  I have recommended this book to my family, friends and book clubs.  Great job!  I'm looking forward to reading some of Mr. Lloyd Johnson's other work. </s>"
141,Successful use of Social Networking and how it can be used in business </s>,"summarize: Like most other reviews stated, this book examines the use of modern Social Networking tools (like Facebook, custom websites for grassroots purposes, text messaging, etc.) in President Obama's successful 2008 campaign.  The book then applies those uses to modern day business, trying to convince the reader how a business could succeed if it were to follow the Obama campaign's model.

Overall, I felt it was an ok and quick read.  I felt, however, that it already states the obvious for any business person who wishes to implement the use of social networking in their business. </s>"
142,Suspense and historical fiction with great character development </s>,"summarize: Loved this sweet historical fiction. It was not an over bearing romance, had suspense and it allowed you to feel you were immersed in this time period. I enjoyed the character development and was distracted from my life just a bit as I found myself repeatedly opening my kindle to read just a bit more. Completely enjoyed this story. </s>"
143,12 kept showing up on my recommended list so I finally decided to take the plunge </s>,"summarize: This is the first book that I have read by Sean Platt and David Wright.  12 kept showing up on my recommended list so I finally decided to take the plunge.  I was impressed by the writing style and the steady pacing of the story.  The characters were well-developed, and I felt that I cared what happened to the characters.  I found myself unable to put this book down and wanting to read just one more chapter.  I read for pleasure and escape and this book certainly filled the bill.  Given the chance, I will definitely be reading another book by Platt and Wright. </s>"
144,this captured my attention from the first page of Deliver to the last page of Vanquish </s>,summarize: I had no idea how I'd feel about Van after meeting him in the previous novel Deliver. I can honestly say I loved getting to know this complicated man. He is so much more than the sadistic almost inhuman person he appeared to be especially when he meets Amber. I am a huge Pam Godwin fan and this story captured and kept my time and attention until the last page. I didn't want the story to end. </s>
145,3 1/2 stars:  not as enjoyable as the others I read in the series. </s>,"summarize: I didn't quite like this one as much as book 2 as it was a little too cynical with one side character and the how the big bad guy was defeated felt too easy and lacking in imagination for me.  However, I did enjoy book 2 and the short story 1.5, so if there's another in this series, I would definitely try it. </s>"
146,"A highly action packed story of love, mystery and violent retribution </s>","summarize: Jack is an alpha male. A leader of his pack. Seeking justice for the death of his parents he finds the chance when an omega is attacked by the same unknown assailant. Mating him to save his life and possibly get information to end  the mystery unleashes new troubles. A highly action packed story of love, mystery and violent retribution. The love story was delightful, the mystery was engaging and the retribution, though a bit grizzly, brought justice to the story. A very enjoyable book. I received a free advanced review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. </s>"
147,I like what the author is implying about today's youth more than I like the writing itself. </s>,summarize: I liked this book primarily because I like what the author seems to be implying. That the children of today would come through if they faced a catastrophe. I'm not so sure that the kids today would be as resourceful as the children in the book. These children have the advantage of coming from an intact family/two parent household. </s>
148,I really enjoyed this book for both the inner and the outer landscapes depicted </s>,"summarize: This book takes you places, and the author doesn't just portray her adventures in these varying parts of the world, but also paints her inner landscape as she deals with various relationship troubles, with friends and boyfriend.  Well worth the read, if you have interest in spirituality and/or other parts of the world. </s>"
149,This story was crazy but good. Kira was wrong for sleeping with Chance </s>,summarize: This story was crazy but good. Kira was wrong for sleeping with Chance. But hey he was just as wrong as her if not more. I didn't like Tesa at all she should've been more of a friend than a jealous back stabbing broad. She needed to get a life. I liked Mel he seemed like a good dude. TJ knew what goes on it the dark definitely comes to light. He needed that beat down. Sara is definitely a woman scorned. Who will survive in pt. 2 </s>
150,Don't Let the Lousy Cover Foo You...This Really is a Great Story! </s>,"summarize: BOOOOOOO! To Genesis Press for giving this great story such a lousy cover! (They did this with another author Crystal Hubbard in the past too).

Yeeeah! To Mz. Chamein for delivering another great story. Believable characters, a plot that moves well and even points of comedy! I really enjoyed this story and I look forward to more books by Mz. Chamein.

I enjoyed how Abbey was a single working mom who has it all together - her confidence is great and I love how well she works with her partner, Shana.

Love hits when you least expect it... I got next! :) </s>"
151,Alyson creates this entire world that sucks you in and makes you question every person </s>,"summarize: Holy hell!!! This book.....my brain is still trying to process. Traitor is a book unlike anything I've ever read. Alyson creates this entire world that sucks you in and makes you question every person, word, and movement. Just when I thought I had everything figured out, I was thrown for a loop.

Traitor definitely gave my heart a workout! Got the good old pulse up, thanks for that. </s>"
152,I really enjoyed Offerman's style - quite entertaining and vocabulary rich </s>,"summarize: I really enjoyed Offerman's style - quite entertaining and vocabulary rich. Had me going to the dictionary on more than one occasion. I was a little turned off by the first two people highlighted, but each chapter was better than the one preceding. I enjoyed his sense of humor immensely, and even have curiosity about woodworking. Thoroughly enjoyable read. </s>"
153,What happens when the Democrats adopt all the worst GOP policies?. </s>,summarize: This is a heartbreaking book for any new deal democrat. This explains how the party that helped the unions rise and was helped by them turned their collective back on workers except bankers and hedge fund salesman. It explains how Glass-Stiegel trickled down to Dodd-Frank and may just disappear. It explains how we can call a jobless anything a recovery. It explains why when the market collapsed it was not necessary to send any of the conmen responsible to prison and what disguise the divine right of kings is currently wearing. Nothing actually explains NAFTA and TAPP. </s>
154,"Why Nations fail. The Origins of power , Prosperity and Poverty by Daron Acemoglu , James A.Robinson </s>","summarize: I am surprised that there is hardly a paragraph or two written devoted on India. India,since its independence from colonial rulers -the United Kingdom, has undergone substantial political & economical changes by transforming into an inclusive society. The process of transformation,even though slow and long, but Inspite all it's ills such as casteism , divergent populations of religious , regional , language orientations, is something to learn from. The author seems rather biased against India. I thought it didn't provide anything insightful -- waste of money. </s>"
155,"When I saw that Scotty Cade had written a book about two attendees falling in love, I knew I had to read it </s>","summarize: I have read several of Scotty Cades books and always come away with a smile on my face.  This one was absolutely one that held my interest and one I could not put down till I finished.  The Citadel has always intrigued me because of Pat Conroy and the books he wrote about his experiences there.  When I saw that Scotty Cade had written a book about two attendees falling in love, I knew I had to read it.  It definitely made me wonder where he was going with the story and how it would end.  I was happy to feel that the ending may leave more in the future and it not then a happy ending at least. </s>"
156,Not your Typical So Sweet I want to Gag Romance. Characters have real problems and depth.  I could not put it down! </s>,"summarize: Both Tatum and Jacoby have serious issues in their past that weave through the story giving depth the the characters and the situations they face.  I did not know what to expect when I began reading about the ""Forbidden Love"" and at first was concerned that this book was not to my taste. I couldn't have been more wrong.  A.M. Wilson delivered characters and a story that pulled the reader right in and made us a part of the book.  I could not put it down.  This is not your typical so sweet I could gag romance.  I love it. </s>"
157,This book is a must read to understand how the Muslum heatred recruits and trains terriorists today. </s>,"summarize: This book is a must read for the entire free world to understand how Muslum hatetred has preverted two generations, if not 8,000 generations, to hate, kill, poison, and bomb western civilization. What happened to Hyun Hee Kim, is happening daily in the Muslem world to young and old alike.
Interestingly, the solution to the problem may be the same as what happened to Kim?
A gripping read.  It will change your thinking. </s>"
158,I really came to care for Annabelle Lee and to identify with her toughness. </s>,"summarize: Would. Have given 5 stars but Claudia going to Las Vegas alone and telling No one of her plans left me with an unbelievable feeling.  Come on, this is a brilliant woman.  Making such a bad judgment call at such a critical time.  Anyway, the remaining of the book is awesome.  I really came to care for Annabelle Lee and to identify with her toughness. </s>"
159,Enjoyable reading if you like the story in which everything happens the way you want to see happen. </s>,"summarize: This is the book for almost anyone who is interested in historical novels. You enjoy reading it since the story seems to develop as the way any readers would expect or want to happen. But, such story telling is a double edged sword; it keeps readers glue to the pages but not much is left after finish reading it.

May be I am spoiled by the impact I felt after reading The Winds of War. </s>"
160,... number of books I've read this year that I loved (and I read a lot of books) </s>,"summarize: I can honestly count on one hand the number of books I've read this year that I loved (and I read a lot of books), and contemporary isn't usually my thing (I'm a historical fiction fan). But I absolutely loved this book. It was funny, tender, sad and poignant and the characters felt truly real to me. The pacing was perfect, the plot and subplots were expertly woven and I cried happy and sad tears while reading it. Any book that evokes an emotion in me, let alone multiple emotions, is a five-star in my book. I look forward to reading more of Nyhan's work. </s>"
161,"I liked, was slow at first but as always the end was decent, now Spoilers Ahead! </s>","summarize: Ok, Sidney is very smart but she always forgets the important stuff! Seriously, is it so hard to connect everything?

I Loved Adrian returning to art and hoy he uses the mustang so he can be with Sydney!

Eddy loves Jill bus she is a Dragomir! She must have like 10000 moroi children! Ok, Lisa and Christian can have the 10000 moroi children so Jill can be with Eddy.

Poor Angelique ...

The final, Adrian pouring his heart and what Sydney does? Gosh! Kill me now!

Well, see what happens in the following :) </s>"
162,An emotionally charged read that will play your emotions like a fiddle. </s>,"summarize: This book was frustrating, emotional, disturbing and thought-provoking at turns. You'll need an emotional palate cleanse after this one or maybe just a hug. I'm honestly still coming to terms with how I feel about this one - some of the big reveals have left me a bit raw but it was also well written and  gave a lot of food for thought, no pun intended. </s>"
163,It dives into using this innovation further bolstering your good fortune. Nonetheless if there's leeway </s>,"summarize: Extraordinary stuff to know more from past the surface of Blockchain. It dives into using this innovation further bolstering your good fortune. Nonetheless if there's leeway, there's very a few impediments and threats in utilizing this innovation. It's smarter to take in these data first so we will realize what to confront while wandering in this innovation. </s>"
164,"Boring, feels forced--unless you're a real devotee of Bracken's I wouldn't advise this book </s>","summarize: I got this for my mother a few months ago, based on her delight with Peg Bracken's I Hate To Cook Book. (Get that one first if you haven't read it and you think you might like Ms. Bracken's writing.)

This one is not as good. It drags, it feels forced, and at last ask, Mom hadn't even enjoyed it enough to finish reading it.

YMMV, but to me this was a gift boo-boo. </s>"
165,The closest thing to an HEA that she's written....that I've read. </s>,"summarize: I don't like people who play games, and that's all they did for three books. By the time I got my HEA I didn't really think any of them deserved it.  Please note that this is my critique of the content. I still think the author is very talented. I just wish it weren't misery she was spreading around. I get enough of that in real life.

I do think I respect it though, on some level. Despite my desire for HEA's ...I get disgusted with HEA books that make no sense. I don't think everything is forgiven just because the couple finally sleeps together, or gets hitched. </s>"
166,Tschiffely's Ride: Ten Thousand Miles in the Saddle from Southern Cross to Pole Star </s>,"summarize: This is a great book, a real interesting page turner. It is great for all ages. My children all read it when they were in middle school and loved it. It gets passed around our family and friends with, ""This is really a great book"". It is fun to read and exciting to contemplate this guy's ride through South America with all that befalls him. </s>"
167,First in a series combining good storytelling and a great new romance </s>,"summarize: Gerri Hill creates great characters and Tori Hunter is one of the best.  Tori is a top class pain in the backside with a bad attitude which extends way beyond her role as a homicide detective and right through her tenuous working relationships.

Along comes a new partner who won't give up pushing at Tori's bad tempered boundaries and the scene is set for a well done manhunt with an unusual twist and a well written lesbian romance.

Great start that will no doubt become a well established series. </s>"
168,Fantasy YA: Sweet tale of an enslaved healer learning her true power </s>,"summarize: A lovely coming-of-age novel about an enslaved girl, living on the plains, forced to use her magical healing on her captures despite being shunned for her 'abhorrent' abilities. Until the camp is raided.

Well-rounded characters, intriguing world building, and a well-paced story. I would definitely recommend this. </s>"
169,"I'm glad that I started with this book, when I first started to learn to play the guitar., </s>","summarize: As someone else mentioned, and as it says in the book, there is enough material in this book to keep you busy for
about 2 years, but it covers the basics very well, and takes you step by step, with classical guitar instruction.  At the end of the book, Frederick Noad emphasizes the importance of learning the fretboard - the notes on the guitar.
To learn all the notes on the guitar, I'd recommend ""Philip's Learn ALL the Notes on the Guitar Flash Cards."" </s>"
170,That being said the content is very thorough and easy to understand </s>,"summarize: This book is heavily repetitive, often recycling several pages of information throughout the chapters, which could be beneficial for classes which skip chapters or review chapters out of order but given the nature of most EMT programs I hope that is not the case. The book also introduces several procedures and techniques in the early chapters and makes no attempt to define or explain them until further chapters. That being said the content is very thorough and easy to understand. </s>"
171,Best book about President Trump and his qualities as a leader. </s>,"summarize: This is a groundbreaking document and a worth piece of information regarding the President's persona. While it doesn't really give us any information that we didn't already knew, it is the admirable and detailed compilation of ideas what makes this book such a titanic monster.

The book is really easy to read and to understand, and it doesn't take sides on any issues, it says says it like it is.

Highly recommended!! </s>"
172,Highly recommend for those who have ever been injured playing sports </s>,"summarize: This book is absolutely incredible. I have suffered from many injuries (broken bones in my foot, a broken tail bone, 3 torn ligaments in my knee, 1 torn ligament in my foot.... the list goes on). I did not realize until after reading this book, that it is not my body that is the problem, it is rather an issue of the athletic events and training regimens that I choose. I never realized that there are so many different factors which should really go into selecting your targeted sport. </s>"
173,I'd like to be inside Cora Brent's head. It's very entertaining in there! </s>,"summarize: I've been reading the same redundant books for a while until Unruly.  Finally, a compelling story, that was beautifully written and the kindle burned on through the night. Cora Brent's writing style is very rich, descriptive and entertaining. It's one of those books where you forget you're reading because you're so caught up in the story. A fantastic story, </s>"
174,"Little of value as military fiction, not much sci-fi either, but a whole lot of political rhetoric </s>","summarize: It's not science fiction. It's barely military fiction. It appears to be constructed to appeal to a political fringe group that is gung ho for idealistic marine rhetoric and likes to read about bullies getting spanked. The constant political commentary might be excused if was balanced with clever story, well considered strategy, or even some interesting sci-fi tech or twists. But no -- none of that here. Nuttall's has published better work. The Ark Royal series was a better effort by far. </s>"
175,A great read that is readily actionable for just about anyone </s>,"summarize: The first time I read Keith Ferrazzi's Never Eat Alone was when I was pursuing entrepreneurial interests in Beijing, China back in 2006. This practical and entertaining book taught me well and helped beef up my own skill set in people relationship building and networking in both the Western world and the Eastern one. A great read that is readily actionable for just about anyone! Highly recommended! </s>"
176,"Couldn't put it down! Adventure, intrigue, romance... this series has it all! </s>","summarize: As with book 1, The Prophecy, The Outlanders is full of plot twists and unexpected turns which had me turning page after page dying to see what happened next! My heart melts while my stomach drops as I read about Layla and her complicated romance. And I do mean complicated....
 The story is full of entertaining adventure and intriguing mystery. I can't wait to find out the fate for all these characters! </s>"
177,This book should be mandatory reading when you have a daughter! </s>,"summarize: If you have daughters, you need this book.  If you know someone with daughters, gift them this book.  As the Mom of 2 daughters and 2 stepdaughters, I know from experience the examples in this book are realistic and I read many of these chapters shaking my head in agreement.  I also had several light bulb moments reading through this book.  For example, the hot potato example and the swimming pool example.  Very, very helpful and I highly recommend taking a weekend to read this book.  I am a better Mom for having read this book. </s>"
178,There is no way the character in the first book would react like the loser in the second </s>,summarize: I am having a very hard time finishing this book. Alice has changed from a determined and self controlled survivor to a loser willing to crawl into a bottle to cope. There is no way the character in the first book would react like the loser in the second. Authors should not write characters experiencing PTSD if they don't understand human nature. So disappointing. </s>
179,My fave Jiffy Kate read...so far! Never stop chasing castles! </s>,"summarize: Oh em geeee!!! This book was so emotional and beautiful! This may be my fave of the series! With so much history between Deacon and Camille, the story grabs a hold of you and never lets go! I so love Annie and her words of wisdom! This story you will need tissues lol it was so beautiful and just amazing! You cant deny the love of Deacon and Camille, you feel it in you heart, the writing that Jiffy Kate gives it just fantastic and perfect! The totally deserve their happily every after and again the love Deacon and Camille is one thats unforgettable! </s>"
180,I quickly bought this one and have just started to read it and already know it is the best one yet </s>,"summarize: My friend at work handed me Crazy Rich Asians at work one day and I read it cover to cover in a weekend, I picked up the next Kevin Kwan book and again read it cover to cover in one weekend. I quickly bought this one and have just started to read it and already know it is the best one yet!
I might have to savor this one because I don't know when he will right the next one.

Update: Just finished this book and it did not disappoint! What a ride! Thank you for a great read Kevin Kwan. Whew. </s>"
181,"Awful narration and a mediocre story. Too much Indian ""minutae"". </s>","summarize: This is my second Cork O'Connor book and I really did not care for it. The plot was ok but the characters weren't really developed well and the constant description of Indian culture and beliefs became torturous for me. I am not really sure if I will buy another Cork book!

 I finished the book only because it was an Audible recording and I could do other things without missing much. My mind started to wander right after Cork and friend got captured.  The narrator is awful, All of the characters voices sounded the same and he has a rather high voice which annoyed me. </s>"
182,"This is his best book, and I've loved everything he's written </s>","summarize: This is quite possibly his best book.  I've loved everything he's written, but this book elevates Max Barry's writing from just smart and funny into the realms of the highest quality science fiction.  This is a book about words, and Max Barry's use of words is in top form.  It's not only brilliant and insightful, but fun to read.

If you like Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, then you've got to try this book. </s>"
183,Kaiju Is Back and Eric S Brown is Taking it to a Whole New Level. Five Star Fiction </s>,"summarize: Kaiju is back. Eric S Brown is back and together they make an unstoppable team.

The perfect mix of Military SF and Horror, this tale brings so much to the table that the reader cannot help but read in awe as the author spins a tale that excels in all directions.

I loved the first installment of Kaiju and loved this one just as much. I know there is a third volume out, I already own it. So I know what I am going to be reading tonight. </s>"
184,WITH SOME EDITING THIS WOULD BE PERFECT FOR LITTLE KIDS. THEY WOULD LOVE THE MONKEY. </s>,"summarize: The best thing about this book was it's short. This was so silly and predictable I kept thinking I picked up my 8 year old granddaughters book by mistake. Even the lusty stuff seemed juvenile and silly. Lizzy and Diesel reminded me of Joe and Stephine. They were the same characters with the same dynamics. And what was up with the monkey? The cat didn't really add to the story either, I guess another hampster would be all to familiar. </s>"
185,"Worth the read - it's interesting, melodic and out of your time and experience </s>","summarize: When a book drives me to look up more information, in this case about Iceland and the author, I know it is good. 'Burial Rites' is a  relatively slow paced but well-written read that somehow keeps you on the edge. You enter another age, another period of time and another very different type of country. Thinking back on my journey through the book, it was like bathing in mollasses while a killer stood by and tentatively smiled. </s>"
186,"WOW! You've gotta have this book! IF, you want to get your ass out ALIVE! </s>","summarize: You watched him on Dual Survival, now get into the wit and wisdom of Cody Lundin! Keep it on your device! Keep a copy in your back pack or bug-out bag! You won't be sorry! You can read it over and over to let the skills sink in deep. Survival situations can happen to anyone at anytime. Get a copy for someone you love! </s>"
187,Oh no!  Now I have to wait for tthe next April Grace book!!!! </s>,"summarize: I am a complete fan of April Grace whose metaphors, similes and overestimates are truly delightful.  I know this book in theory is for grades 3-8 but I am a long-time adult (otherwise known as an old fart) AND I see nothing in the April Grace series that any adult would not enjoy thoroughly.  These books make for great chuckles, sweet moments, and adventure.  April Grace says often that she's trying to be a better person.  After reading these books I feel like they make me a better person....so thank you to April Grace and her wonderful writer KD McCrite.  Another book well done! </s>"
188,18 month old daughter loves it...screeeeams if I read a different book! </s>,"summarize: I just started reading this to my almost 18mo old girl.  It gets very wordy and repetetive, and I thought she didn't like it because she kept wanting to skip over the pages that had over 5 lines of print, but she does really love it so much that if I put it down and pick up another book, she howls and throws a temper tantrum. </s>"
189,No rogues this time - clear an unabashed moral codes.  Bravo! </s>,"summarize: This is a great introduction to a very promising series.  The plot is tight and, while the characters are somewhat formulaic, they are not cardboard.  What really makes this series interesting is the character of William Sparhawk, a young officer with a very high moral code.  Since this is the introductory volume, there is much to explore and develop; but that's what makes reading so enjoyable.  We can see how this universe develops how each individual becomes more 'real'.

Mr. Larson - when does the next book come out? </s>"
190,Fascinating Travel Memoir That Delves Deeply Into Sicilian Culture </s>,"summarize: A fascinating travel memoir that delves into the history, ethos, culture, art, religion, architecture, people, politics, violence and beauty of Sicily. Francine Prose is a very gifted writer and her language is exquisite. That, paired with the fascinating history of Sicily, kept me riveted. Probably not for everyone because it's not your typical travel memoir. She doesn't reinvent herself, buy an old house and renovate it, or anything like that. She just spends a month in Sicily delving deeply into the culture. As someone of Sicilian descent, this resonated with me very much. </s>"
191,Equally covered were the events leading up to World War I and what it might have been like to live through those times </s>,"summarize: For history and sociology buffs, this historical fiction provides so much insight into the lifestyles of those in the developed world in the World War I era. I gained insight into life under the czar and how and why the Russian Soviet Revolution garnered so much support. Equally covered were the events leading up to World War I and what it might have been like to live through those times. </s>"
192,Poilitical Fantasy about modern life.  A wonderful take on Progressive vs everyone else. </s>,summarize: Leninger writes really well and can take any story and make it interesting.  This has to do with current political events in a fantasy setting and it kept me following it all the time.  This is the second book of Leninger's I have read and both are really different but I will read more.  A good read from a picky reader. </s>
193,Incredible Book for those looking to explore/grow in their faith in God! </s>,"summarize: Phenomenal book for both those exploring their faith in God and those that have been believers for a long time! Shawn does an incredible job interlacing his personal story (incredible background) with the basic principals that will allow you to grow stronger in your faith. Shawn Johnson is the lead pastor at Red Rocks Church in Colorado (and Brussels, Belgium) and is an unbelievable teacher.  I highly recommend this book! </s>"
194,Couldn't wait to get to the end; then sad to leave my new friends! </s>,"summarize: I read this book so fast because I wanted to know how it ended--hoping for a happy ending. But when I closed the last page, I was sad because I was going to miss Juliette, and Lucas, and everyone in Silo 18. Brilliant, brilliant book by an author I'm looking forward to reading more of. After reading many YA and other dystopic novels, I can't seem to read anything set in current day reality. This book is a thrill ride like no other! </s>"
195,... than a few copies in the life of its great author. But why </s>,"summarize: The book did not sell more than a few copies in the life of its great author. But why? The reason is obvious: in his lifetime, Hume's philosophy was above the level of his contemporaries. Of course, this book became very highly prized two centuries later, and remains one of the best books in all philosophy. Indeed, the only philosophy book that might be considered slightly better is the book that Hume himself wrote some years later to expound and explain the ideas of the ""Treatise on Human Nature"" in a more readable style! </s>"
196,"A memoir that that takes you , grabs you and will leave you dazed. </s>","summarize: Alan Cummings tells of his life as though he he was right here talking to you. And you cry, fear, laugh and rejoice with him.  He is a most worthy soul and we are blessed he cared enough to share with us.  Read and become aware that we don't know other people well and what made them.  So love and kindness give out to others in abundance! </s>"
197,Did I say Three Kingdoms was Luo Guanzhong's greatest literary accomplishment </s>,"summarize: Did I say Three Kingdoms was Luo Guanzhong's greatest literary accomplishment?  Much like Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in Commando, I LIED!  This is so much better that it blows the Three Kingdoms into smithereens then recreates them as a fourth, somewhat less violent kingdom populated by unicorns, fairies and rainbows.  Must read. </s>"
198,Enjoyed but looking to read the previous book to get the full story. </s>,"summarize: 'Divine Awakening' by Lia Davis is book Four in the ""The Divinities"" series.  I have not yet read the other books and I do strongly feel that you should do so as this seems to continue a story that has been going on in the previous books.  Ms. Davis writing was really nice so I was able to enjoy this book but I am going to follow up with getting the other books in this story since I enjoyed this one so much. ""My honest review is for a special copy I voluntarily read."" </s>"
199,"Use all your College Algebra resources, apply yourself and get an 'A' </s>",summarize: Awesome! Thank you so much. Arrived in a timely manner and was EXACTLY what I needed for my College Algebra class at college (though I saved some $$ not buying it from the college book store). The code worked... no problems whatsoever. Packaged nicely. The graphing calculator book is semi-helpful (no fault of the seller's)...it's more of a use it or lose it participation thing. Use TI83 with the coordinating loose textbook you'll make your algebra (graphing) life much better. I'm fortunate enough to have a fantastic team of math professors that are very helpful. </s>
200,it is most definitely my favorite book (and I read 111 books in 2014 </s>,"summarize: I already read a library copy of this book twice in late 2014...I just ordered the Kindle edition so I could have it to read again and again, plus I ordered the paperback edition, due out in April, so that I can underline and highlight and otherwise mark & question the book...it is most definitely my favorite book (and I read 111 books in 2014!) of the year.

There is much depth in the book and each time you read it it's like turning over yet another leaf...something new each time. </s>"
201,Berlin P.I. Noir Bernie Gunther travels the ratline to Argentina </s>,summarize: Bernie Gunther's ratline journey brings his detective skills to Argentina where he solves cold cases from his time in the police force and discovers that the cruelty of his former homeland was alive and well in South America. As always in Kerr's novels familiar names from history appear as central characters in this fast past story. </s>
202,"I love the Kim Stone series, and Blood Lines could be my favorite thus far. </s>","summarize: Another winner from Angela Marsons. I have pre-ordered the last 3 books and when the day finally comes it feels like Christmas morning. I always have a hard time putting her books down and this round was the most difficult. Blood Lines was full of suspense. I enjoyed the multiple plot lines and large cast of characters. It really kept me guessing. It is necessary to read the other books in the series to understand this one, but you should do that anyways! </s>"
203,Falling in love with a murder would likely cause problems for anyone </s>,"summarize: A turbulent roller coaster of mayhem, destruction and death. Author Celia Aaron kept me on my toes with this read. Falling in love with a murder would likely cause problems for anyone. In this story, Charlie, a quite florist with a dark past finds herself the object of a murders affection. After being thrust into his destructive world Charlie must fight to save herself. While battling unwarranted feeling for a cold-blooded killer. I hope to see stories developed for supporting characters.
I will defiantly be making time to read Celia Aaron's other books. </s>"
204,ADAPTIVE PRACTICAL AND HARD FIGHTING SOLDIERS AGAINST AMAZING ODDS </s>,"summarize: I learned a great deal by reading about how the South Africans adapted their doctrine and tactics based upon terrain and how the enemy operated.  Their integration of vehicles, trackers and helicopters to intercept guerrillas in the bush is worth the price of the book.  Very well written and informative.  They also successfully fought conventional Cuban forces equipped with Soviet armor.  Our armed forces can learn a lot by studying these operations. </s>"
205,Awesome encourage manual to have as it covers all that you have to think about Amazon Alexa </s>,"summarize: Awesome encourage manual to have as it covers all that you have to think about Amazon Alexa and the substance aren't that specialized so I could get the hang of everything effectively. Credit to the creator! Like this book says "" Technology is changing quick "" we have to ride alongside it as opposed to getting left behind. </s>"
206,My Greek mother loved this book (and she was a heck of a cook!) </s>,"summarize: My mother (who would be 104 had she lived till now) used this book while I was growing up in the mid fifties and sixties and I obtained a copy when it cost a heck of a lot less, which is the one cookbook I use all the time (I also use Huntley Dent's wonderful Santa Fe cookbook too). I am horrified at how expensive it is: I would have liked to buy copies for my kids and nieces and nephews for Christmas. Oh well. If you're rich you should buy it. Maybe they'll reprint it for us poor folk. </s>"
207,... book free for an honest review This is an amazing book. The characters are well developed </s>,"summarize: I received this book free for an honest review

This is an amazing book. The characters are well developed, the scenes draw you right into their world.  The story just comes to life for you from beginning to end.  There's is a little bit of everything in this book and I can't wait to read more from this author.  With so many unexpected twists in the story you are never sure about the ending. Keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next. This book is definitely worth reading if you enjoy a well written story.  5 stars all the way.  Happy Reading! </s>"
208,"LOVE THIS BOOK! Love not wanting to put it down and sleep, hate turning the last page. </s>","summarize: LOVE LOVE LOVE  I couldn't put this down at night!  I have never been to Europe, but through Rosamunde Pilcher's beautiful, crafty and very clever ways of allowing you into the lives of her characters, I can almost smell those ocean. To picture the houses, elaborate or tiny cottage be it, it's as if you can feel the warmth or cold in the room.  I love the people she creates, honestly... they become so real and so intricate in their own personality. </s>"
209,I tried REALLY hard to like this book/author but after reading 60% </s>,"summarize: I tried REALLY hard to like this book/author but after reading 60%, I had to delete it. I found nothing redeeming. There was virtually no story line, lots of characters in this little town but you can't keep them straight, jumps from one to groups and back. No character development, however. I found it exceedingly boring and don't understand why the author gets such high ratings </s>"
210,still felt it fell far short of one of America's great novels. Read it again in the 2006 </s>,"summarize: I had to read ""Gatsby"" in college, felt it was meh. Read it again in the 1980's, still felt it fell far short of one of America's great novels. Read it again in the 2006, this time with accompaniment with Cliff Notes. Still, underwhelmed. Saw the Leonardo DiCapri ""Gatsby"" and thought the story had a bit more impact as a love story. Maureen Corrigan's book opened my eyes to  many elements I had missed in the past, and I came away with a greater appreciation of Fitzgerald, but still don't believe it's in  the pantheon on America's best literature. </s>"
211,Not something I really enjoy. Personal taste so not knocking the author </s>,"summarize: I received an arc for an honest review.

It took sometime for me to get into the story.

Initially it seemed Lily had strong backbone but she seemed to lose it through the story line. She just went with what anyone told her to do. Not something I really enjoy. Personal taste so not knocking the author. It was a pleasant read. </s>"
212,Treating everyone like First Class Citizens in The People you Meet In First Class by Eric Pearson </s>,"summarize: I am a people person so I connected with Eric Pearson's book The People You Meet in First Class. People and their stories truly are the best thing in the world and I absolutely agree with Eric when he says ""we are different than the person who sits beside us bur have more in common than just the Row #"" . Waiting in a line up at a store for me is a chance to meet thy neighbor, catch your breath and say hi.  This author shows us how to take in what we see. Great story telling he will make you laugh for sure. </s>"
213,An Excellent Resource for those who aren't mainly Finance people </s>,"summarize: This is an excellent resource for learning all about Hedge Funds and how they work.  This book delves deep enough into the various aspects of Hedge Funds to be very instructive but not too analytical.  Not a book for dummies and not a PhD in Finance reference, a great resource right in the middle. This book is perfect for those who are looking for a relatively in depth knowledge of Hedge Funds without boring themselves with too many analytical and overly academic concepts and theories. </s>"
214,"Slow Moving, but Worth Reading if You Have Read the Twilight Saga </s>","summarize: Bree Tanner is a runaway teen that is living on the streets. Riley finds her and offers her a ""better life"". She's a shy and inteligent girl who proves that she can't be fooled by Riley's lies after her transformation. She mostly keeps to herself and out of the way of any angry vampires in her ""coven"". She has a brief romance and the two of them find out something very interesting about the Volturi that The Twilight Saga never tells you about.

You learn to love Bree and wish the best for her. She's just an innocent victim that struggles to stay alive and do what is right. </s>"
215,"Some of the best of indie sci fi, but cardboard characters abound </s>","summarize: This is one of the best written and edited indie science fiction novels available for Kindle. However, there is never any emotional comnection formed with any single one of the characters, which makes every single person in the book feel a bit one-dimensional. I would have given it three stars, but the editing and portrayal of advanced communications technology in a non ""dues ex machina"" bumped it ip a whole star. </s>"
216,... book dragged - using up pages & pages of boring information on what kind of wagons was need </s>,"summarize: The book dragged - using up pages & pages of boring information on what kind of wagons was needed, what kind of supplies, this thing, that thing - who cares - I finally had to skip over pages of information that could have been written on one page.  It got so boring, I stopped reading it. It seemed like it would take forever to get to a better story line, but didn't have the patience to see if there ever was going to be one. </s>"
217,The Only Predictable Aspect of the Story Line is how Ms. Kellerman will Surprise the Reader by the Conclusion This Time </s>,summarize: Sanctuary  introduces a new element to the Lazuras/Decker ongoing saga by traveling to the always explosive Middle East  as well as illuminating new aspects of Jewish-American Culture like the role of the diamond industry and Israeli community in the complex United States  community through the eyes of Rina and Peter. </s>
218,"Core reading for the next wave of ""engagement"" with customers, citizens and the rest of us! </s>","summarize: With a  comprehensive look at what applying game methods and techniques mean for enterprises, how to use them, and when not to, this book is the foundation that everyone needs  before they go diving into the brave new world of gamification.. which they MUST!
I'd also look at ""Serious Games for Business"" by Boinodiris to see how this gamification ""journey"" began and where it's going. </s>"
219,"Having the perspective of a ""liberal Northerner"" lent a great slant to the story </s>","summarize: My book club read this along with To Kill a Mockingbird.  I found this book ver evocative of the period of desegregation in the South and the changes wrought in the social relationships.  Harper Lee was returning home for a visit from New York City.  Having the perspective of a ""liberal Northerner"" lent a great slant to the story.  It also looks @ the changing relationship between Scout and her father.  Not everyone in  my book club liked it.  I thought it rounded out the brave young Scout who idolized her father to the young adult Scout: still a rebel but now not so sure of her beliefs. </s>"
220,A waste of energy.  It takes less energy to think it through than to look it up and read all the required points. </s>,"summarize: This is nothing more than a collection of lists  of things to include in treatment plans.  It is a recipe book, so you don't have to think about the client - just choose a diagnosis and copy the pages for that.  the problem is that every plan has over fifty items.  If I read through, or worse - copy out all the items on one list - it takes more time and energy than to actually think about what I ought to do for the client.  I would rather think it through.  It takes less time and energy than going through these lists. </s>"
221,Worth reading for historical perspective on issues we still are facing. </s>,"summarize: The information in this book is enlightening but not always easy to get through.  The politics and resulting devastation to Guademala is heart breaking but this volume very well written with interesting presented in 3 historical time periods.  At the finale, the loops are tied together in a satisfying conclusion, considering the subject matter. </s>"
222,An awesome read with a new twist on a MC chapter story.  A must read! </s>,"summarize: I fell in love with the King's Harlots series reading Grit, I anxiously and impatiently waited for Stain and was absolutely blown away by it!

The story line grabbed my attention it's emotional, deep and satisfying enough to keep me up reading the whole night! The characters are hot, complex and lovable they grabbed my heart and took it for a heck of a ride. I can't wait for another book in this series.

This is not your typical MC series... it's so much more ! </s>"
223,The advice he gives is actionable and has me feeling like I can speak after all </s>,"summarize: Cody nails it! Im not a public speaker and never aspired to be one. It terrifies me, so the name of the book rightly fits! Since launching my book, I keep receiving speaking engagement requests. Not something I expected at all! Im so thankful for this book. The advice he gives is actionable and has me feeling like I can speak after all! Thank you, Cody! You wrote a book that will make me feel like a winner! </s>"
224,Entertaining read with historical and familial context. Two thumbs up </s>,"summarize: A fun read with historical background. The hangman, Jakob Kuisl, is based on the author's long line of hangmen ancestors. Mr Potzsch quickly educates the reader on the difficulties of being the punisher in charge. Oliver Potzsch writes clearly and entertainingly in this tale of Bavarian history and a strong, loving family. I was immediately drawn by the writing and notwithstanding what I thought was no interest in Bavaria or German history I'm on the fourth hangmans daughter book. Need I say more? </s>"
225,This made me understand why Shabbat is so important to so many Jews </s>,"summarize: Even if you are not an observant person, you should read this book. I came to realize how important shabbat can be, not only as a spirital moment, but also as an art of living, as an aesthetics of life. This book is interesting to read even if you are not an orthodox Jew (it speaks to every Jew), and even if you are not a Jew. It is a very enriching window on a specific mindset and culture. </s>"
226,if you know any lil ol ladies you will laugh...and then wonder about them </s>,"summarize: I read this in an evening as after the first chuckle I was hooked! I was laughing out loud and enjoyed it thoroughly. I went on to read all six books in the series this past week, they go quickly. I won't tell you what the books are about...enough of that elsewhere, I will tell you I am not sorry one bit to have spent my hard earned money for for this series.  Buy this series if you want some fun in your reading! Only regret is that I am always disappointed when I read ""The End"" the adventure came to an end all too fast. </s>"
227,"The First on what is now a series of really fine, fun, mysteries </s>","summarize: Oliver Potzsch has made reading a mystery book fun again. By writing mysteries based somewhat on his ancestors, he takes us back in time to Germany of the Seventeenth Century. His is not a rose colored world, it is unpleasant, nasty, full of superstitions and omens and people fighting as usual for power and wealth. If you are a person on knowledge and wit you might likely be hung or burned at the stake. This is more than just a fun vacation or summer read. </s>"
228,"Okay for the car repair shop waiting room, but find something else next time. </s>","summarize: Anya has the capability to write very humorous stories, but she needs to stay away from ridiculous.  Penelope could have been a naive but charming girl, but there were too many cases where she was just infantile.  The hero was much to volatile; one minute he's acting tender and two pages later he hates her again.
Also, I tend to stay away from stories that end with animals as part of the wedding. </s>"
229,Best if its kind concerning the biblical support for infant and scriptural baptism! </s>,"summarize: I was absolutely impressed by the depth and amount of biblical truth covered in this book!  Of anything that I have read to date, it is the the best of its kind in showing the biblical ground and support not only for infant baptism, but the instrumentality of baptism in being baptized into the death of Christ.  If you are looking for a book that presents the arguments from both sides of the argument for and against and then demonstrates the convincing and compelling argument for scriptural baptism then this book will be a tremendous help to you! </s>"
230,"""Tapping In"" for proper mental processing - or How to Get from Limbic to Cortex with Bi-lateral Stimulation </s>","summarize: ""Tapping In"" by Laurel Parnell is a great self-help book for properly processing difficult memories, stressful situations or for genuinely letting go of lingering emotional residues that are preventing the past from being THE PAST rather than a continuing parallel aspect of your present. Great explanation for why this technique is effective and how to do it with the best possible results in mind. She's very thorough.  The basics of bi-lateral stimulation using physical touch rather than the EMDR techniques with which she is also fluently versed. Good job! </s>"
231,Want to be a missionary or evangelist?  Then this is your book! </s>,"summarize: I was expecting a book about how to determine your life's purpose, as in, how to choose the right career, etc.  I have never heard of the author before, maybe if I had done some research I could have been spared from reading this.  Well, I didn't actually finish reading it, I couldn't.  too much scripture/Jesus/etc.  If you are hoping that your life purpose is to become an evangelist or a missionary, then this book is for you. </s>"
232,... this book not knowing what to expect and I'm happy to say i really enjoyed it </s>,"summarize: I went into this book not knowing what to expect and I'm happy to say i really enjoyed it.

This book took me a while to actually get into the story but once i got into it I was addicted. I completely fell in love with Justice even though he was a jerk.

The only problem I had with this book was how abruptly it ended, I hate when a book just ends with things left unresolved and that is how this book was finished. </s>"
233,Amazon is really great when you want to get things/books/whatever you need </s>,summarize: Beatrice Small is a fascinating writer - she gets the 'small details' of real history woven into her stories in such a way that it makes you go & look up what happened - get the full picture.  The seller provided a book in top shape and in a short time period.  Amazon is really great when you want to get things/books/whatever you need! </s>
234,It's easy to follow with well-written explanations and examples </s>,"summarize: I'm the Director of Programs for an adult learning center. I researched many resources for GED prep and this book is a gem! It's easy to follow with well-written explanations and examples. The online access is invaluable. I highly recommend this book whether you're in a classroom setting or working on your own.  I recently took the practice GED test and this book is spot on in how it prepares you for the new, common core aligned GED test. </s>"
235,"I loved this book so much that after I finished it, I went back to the beginning and read it all over again! </s>","summarize: ALL IN! This book has surpassed my other long time favorite Lucy Score book-Pretend Your Mine.  Not only was the story a page turner, but full of hilarious one-liners and great supporting characters.  I was especially pleased when I learned that just as I thought the book was ending that the story was just beginning.  Truly hope that this is not the last we see of the supporting characters!  Would love to look in on future Sunday dinners with Frankie's family and insight on more of Frankie and Aiden's life.  Thanks again Lucy for such an amazing read! </s>"
236,"An okay read, but didn't really feel the connection between the lead characters </s>","summarize: While this installment from the series was an okay read, I didn't really feel like the two main characters, Genna and Brody, connected.  It felt more like ""here's the girl, here's the guy, slap 'em together and there's your couple"". I just didn't feel the love and passion that you'd expect.  I also felt like Genna was too weak until about two-thirds of the way through when she finally started standing up for herself to her parents.

A good way to pass some time, but so far I still much prefer the first book from the series. </s>"
237,"I didn't care for it but if you can deal with the unreliable narrator, you might like it. </s>","summarize: This is a challenging book because you are never certain whether you can believe what any of the characters and saying or doing -- people in a mental hospital are the ultimate unreliable narrators.

Because of this, I really struggled with this book and ended up skipping most of it to see what happened at the end.  But just because I didn't care for it, doesn't mean it is a bad book. </s>"
238,"Wonderful book - a must read for teens, but still a pleasure for adults </s>","summarize: Although this book would've been more meaningful if I read it when I was a teenager/entering college, I think all of John Green's books should be read by high schoolers who are looking to find their true identities.  Brilliantly yet simply worded - Green always does a great job portraying the teenage mind accurately and amusingly. </s>"
239,"Once you read this book, you too will want to head for the trail! </s>","summarize: What a great up to date guide for those of us who have wished for a comprehensive and easy to read book!  As an older hiker, contemplating a thru hike the year I retire (2 years from now), I appreciate the information presented in such a well thought out manner. I have read many books and watched quite a few you tube video's, but Chris's book rises to the top of my list of great reads! </s>"
240,"I've signed up only to read the entire series The Lord of the Rings and was deeply disappointed, so just be aware </s>","summarize: BEWARE: Amazon unlimited does not offer The Two Towers or The Return of the King as part of their subscription. Neither audible nor as ebook. I've signed up only to read the entire series The Lord of the Rings and was deeply disappointed, so just be aware.

This is an amazing book, there is nothing more I can add that others have already said in detail. </s>"
241,generally gives enough info to begin serious training. I believe this is real deal knowledge. </s>,"summarize: Not a comprehensive treatise, but does give the general theories toward serious neigong practice, especially the unpopular portions (no sex and extended-period horse stance training). From what I understand,  being an enthusiast of Chinese martial arts studies for about 30 years, this is the theoretical basis for higher-level practice, for when you want  to deliver a feared blow to an opponent, and do recommend this book to any who want to understand the essence of the road to gongfu mastery. </s>"
242,I felt compelled to share this with all my team members  and they are reading it as we speak. </s>,"summarize: omg! is this book awesome or what???? thank you Blake for this amazing BOOK!
Changed my life. I learnt a lot from it and I started working on an ameliorated version
of my business immediately. I felt compelled to share this with all my team members
and they are reading it as we speak. Thank you Blake! </s>"
243,One of My Favorite Books! Does a Tremendous Job of Breaking Down the Game </s>,"summarize: I LOVE this book! I read it over and over. I'm a new coach, and Chris B. Brown really has a way of breaking down the game in an easy-to-understand manner that clearly illustrates what's going on in the more complex aspects of the game. He also delves into the origins of certain schemes providing an historical context for his readers. I would recommend this book to any coach, wanna-be-coach, or fan of the game. </s>"
244,Delicious recipes with a bit less guilt (until you eat the entire cake!) </s>,"summarize: I think the title is misleading, there are many wonderful recipes for breads, snacks and savory pies not JUST cakes!
The ingredients are fresh and vibrant and the recipes are varied and ingenious.
It has a good reference section, for sourcing ingredients and swaps for healthy alternatives.
Finally, there are many wonderful pictures, so you can compare how your creation to theirs ;) </s>"
245,This book is small of course like our very brief constitution </s>,summarize: I think everyone should have a copy of the bible and a copy of the constitution ... especially now when there are so many challenges to our way of life and a do-what congress and president. This book is small of course like our very brief constitution. Once looked at the constitution of another country and was surprised at how long and big it was. ours is so small and easy to know. </s>
246,"Happy, wonderful love story that will leave you wanting more! </s>","summarize: Just loved it!!  It was sweet, romantic, steamy, heartfelt ..just a wonderful love story that I didn't want to end.  He's dynamite..she's strong and fantastic and the supporting cast is delightful.  If your looking for an in depth story with intense plot line and ever evolving characters...this isn't for you.  If you want a wonderful love story ..filled with love..respect..sassy dialogue and a wonderful ending ...then download and enjoy!! </s>"
247,Loved this book! Tom does a great job at teaching you how to be well over all (not just happy) </s>,summarize: I absolutely love Tom Rath's newest book and would recommend everyone read it. I am even getting my teenage daughter to read it as it provides so much valuable information on being well (not just happy) that is great to know at any age. I will be recommending this book to everyone and I will be referring to it time and time again. </s>
248,"PSYCHLOGICAL PENETRATING WRITING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS OF,ROOSEVELT AND TAFT </s>","summarize: Neither president would have  been as creative, inventive , or successful without the combined friendship, collaboration, and support
For each other.  Doris Kearns Goodwin conveys the importance of relationships and personalities in the direction and pathos of history.
Very fun and inspiring to read!!! </s>"
249,"Jaw-dropping tale, not alway smooth reading but deserves a bunch of readers.. </s>","summarize: This tells an absolutely incredible tale, tended to stretch my credibility switch at times to buy into complete acceptance...but I read the entire book!  If nothing else, this an amazing story.  The writing is a tad clunky now and again, that may  relate to to subject matter, but it relates to a sector of history that I don't know a lot about, while thinking of myself as a WWII semi-freak.  The multiple facets of this story are hard to get my arms around, but I have recommended to book to my family members...and I do the same to you.  It's worth a read... </s>"
250,"Beautiful writing, great character, a little disappointing narratively </s>","summarize: Olive Kitteridge is a great character, the language is gorgeous.  Strout gives very small moments incredible suspense.  My one hesitation is that the whole linked stories thing was ultimately a bummer.  I really cared about Olive and after a point, there were stories where she didn't appear.  I found myself skimming the stories for her name.  Still, very much worth reading. </s>"
251,"Absorbing and interesting insights into war, politics and Mexico. </s>","summarize: Reads like an historical novel. Her Frida jumps from the pages as she does from her self-portraits, though I see Selma Hyack in my mind's eye. Using Shepard to guide the reader through history with his poetic commentary is genius. I am certain his name is not an accident. But what really strikes me as magical is Ms. Kingsolver's ability to manufacture each voice as unique and distinctive; a true mistress of her craft. The book is long and not for those looking for a potboiler. It is well crafted and a darned good read. </s>"
252,Dorothea Benton Frank is not a professional narrator - nor should she be. </s>,"summarize: This is a review of the audiobook only. I am a true fan of Dorothea Benton Frank but please....she is not a professional narrator. I was able to reach chapter three before I pulled the plug. I still didn't have any grasp about characters or story line and was becoming increasingly annoyed with the narration. I commute 100 a day and constantly listen to audiobooks but just couldn't continue with this one. Since I order the kindle edition as well as the audio, I will try to read the book when I have a chance. DBF, please write these great books and hire professional narrators. </s>"
253,Raw sugar for the brain (the really good fair trade organic kind!) </s>,"summarize: Allie Brosh delights and surprises in this collection of her web comix. In topics that range from childhood escapades to clinical depression, Allie communicates her life experiences with frankness, bemusement, and hilarity. Thought provoking at times, silly at others, but always enjoyable - this volume is literary brain candy at its best. </s>"
254,It really does pull you in and make you want to be a part of the book. </s>,"summarize: The Author has done a great job with this book. The storyline, plot, all mesh well. You feel the characters as they go through their troubles and excitements, and everyday lives. There is enough excitement, ups and downs to keep you glued to the book. The side characters are well done, ones you want to meet again, and some you have already met. I cannot say enough about this book. It really does pull you in and make you want to be a part of the book. I love how I can see everything as if I was there, standing next to Diarmuid and Aednat as they go through their journey. </s>"
255,great guide in which you will know the history of yoga first! </s>,"summarize: Yoga should be practice by proper knowledge. There things that needs to be learn before engaging to yoga exercise. If you are someone that intend to start your yoga activity, this book is a great guide in which you will know the history of yoga first. You learn the different yoga steps, breathing and movement to gain the best result. This is a great explanation on how yoga is so beneficial especially if you are someone who is in stress and also if you want to lose weight. </s>"
256,"Taoism : A complete introduction to the history, philosophy, and practice of an ancient Chinese spiritual tradition. </s>","summarize: A detailed explanation of Taoism by Eva Wong that enables the reader to understand this often misunderstood ancient Chinese spiritual tradition. Eva says the following on page 1 : "" This book is a guide to the spiritual landscape of Taoism. In it you will encounter events in the history of Taoism, meet the sages who wrote the Taoist texts, be introduced to the various schools of Taoist thinking, and get a feel for what it means to practice Taoism today."" The book is divided into three parts : History of Taoism, Systems of Taoism, and Taoist Practices. </s>"
257,This is book is a great gift for some one who loves the cinema </s>,"summarize: I bought this book as a gift for my son who loves the cinema. He graduated with a degree in Film Studies. I'm certain he loved the book. He ignored his mother and me so he could read the book when we together for Christmas. When he left, he said it was a huge book and that he was excited to have it.

Hopefully, he'll share it with me sometime this year. </s>"
258,One of the most important books in history. But find another version. </s>,"summarize: The Art of War should be considered a must read, regardless of your desire to ever fight in a war.

The lessons about leadership and accountability can be applied to anyone's daily life. Even the lessons about warfare, while told in a very literal sense about real war with real life and death stakes, can be applied to many situations in daily life that have less than lethal consequences.

However, this particular version is not compiled well for the Kindle or Kindle app. The text is just all over the place and is not set up properly. </s>"
259,It takes a very disciplined person to follow through on this sort of diet. </s>,"summarize: This was not hte diet for me. I know it obviously works but like any diet, you have to actually set your mind to do it. I have tried 100's of diets and yes they work, if you do it correctly. I was never able to get into this and just never made it happen. Great for someone who is already on the road to better health. If you have a lot of weight to loose and yo uhave tried everything, this may not be for you because it takes a very disciplined person to follow through on this plan. </s>"
260,"I love C.M. Stunich, but this one just didn't do it for me.  :( </s>","summarize: I had a hard time writing this review.  I have loved C.M. Stunich books, but this one just didn't do it for me.  I liked it, but couldn't get pulled in.  I liked Never's character, but the back and forth between her and Ty was slightly annoying for me.  I found myself really into it, then my interest would drop off.  I stuck it out until the end just because I was hoping I would get more sucked in, but it just didn't happen.  Can't love them all!  :( </s>"
261,REALLY encouraging and full of LIFE - this books helps you in grief </s>,summarize: This book is really anointed - there's truth here that deeply ministers to your heart. It helped me SO much after the sudden passing of a dear friend. I bought copies for several family members for Christmas - my mom said it makes you look forward to going to heaven. She's 86 - that seems like a good thing at her age. Why dread it - Jesus is there waiting for us! I intend to read it again so I bought both the printed and the Kindle version so I can give away the printed one. I gave one to a close friend who just lost her husband and she said it really encouraged her. </s>
262,What you always want to know about George Orwell's thoughts -- but were afraid to ask. </s>,"summarize: A thorough collection of Orwell's best essays, most of which are deeply depressing -- but some, downright humorous.  Orwell, even more than Hemingway, reflects the 'tenor of his times' in vivid personal ruminations on the folly of mankind.  A necessary primer for anyone who considers himself ""liberal"". </s>"
263,Not sure if sprouted grain bread is as tasty as regular grain breads. </s>,"summarize: I've tried one recipe from this book and it came out okay. I will try more, but the sprouted flour is expensive to buy and I'm not sure if I wanted to get into making my own. I know sprouted grains are suppose to be more nutritious, but some of my other recipes using the regular grain flour taste really good. I will give his different recipes a try and see if the taste better. </s>"
264,I honestly wasn't expecting this book to be any good because of the low price tag but OMG </s>,summarize: I honestly wasn't expecting this book to be any good because of the low price tag but OMG! I loved it. I was drawn right into the surprising and hilarious banter between the main characters and I really appreciated that it started differently than most. They are already married but they stick through it anyway. I was really impressed with this book. </s>
265,"Another great tale from Liane! More wives and husbands should ""forget""! </s>","summarize: Another page-turner from Liane Moriarty. I didn't want it to end, and then ordered another book by this author as soon as it did.  This is a poignant story of the realities of adult life- specifically the challenges of maintaining a happy marriage with kids- and a rare look at what happens when all the ""junk"" is forgotten, no matter the cause.  As someone who's been down the road of divorce, I wouldn't wish it on anyone. This book makes you realize than many a marriage might be spared by a ""harmless"" bump on the noggin once in a while. </s>"
266,A VERY ENLIGHTENING BOOK AND CD--ONE TO READ OVER AND OVER AGAIN! </s>,"summarize: Every Deepak Chopra CD or book is very inspiring to me! This one is one of Dr. Chopra's best. Is is a CD that I listen to from time to time and never get tired of listening to it. In fact, each time, there is more meaning to me than the time before. It seems that listening to this CD gets better and better each time. This is a keeper for me! I was so inspired by the CD, I also bought the book. Both are superb! </s>"
267,A great contribution to the growing conversation about our computer-driven world </s>,"summarize: A must-read for anyone (college level or beyond) interested in the pervasive power and accompanying ""mythologies"" of the ""Computer Age.""  It is written across disciplines and is, therefore, equally accessible to those in the Humanities and the Sciences.  A great contribution to the growing conversation about our computer-driven world! </s>"
268,Futuristic contemp - NEVER LET ME GO meets THE FAULT IN OUR STARS </s>,"summarize: This is almost a futuristic contemporary. EXTRAORDINARY MEANS is what would happen if NEVER LET ME GO met THE FAULT IN OUR STARS. Two teens dealing with illness fall in love but man is it sooo much more than that. It is funny and real and it made me cry. There are funny references to Harry Potter, and Tumblr and Secret Starbucks menus, but also deep meaningful conversations. Pretty much Schneider can do no wrong. Between EXTRAORDINARY MEANS & THE BEGINNING OF EVERYTHING, she's done well. Cannot wait for her next book!!!!!!! Perfect perfect perfect </s>"
269,It's probably the most fun I've had reading a book in a long time </s>,"summarize: I am not a gamer or an 80s trivia fanatic, so at first glance you would think that I wouldn't pick this book up. But alas I did and I'll continue to pick it up and reread. It's probably the most fun I've had reading a book in a long time. 100% pure enjoyment - it was funny, fast moving, endearing, and I was completely engrossed. Loved the writing style and how easy I was able to follow along. I felt like I was in the book. Completely refreshing, highly recommend. </s>"
270,"Awesome, quick read. A must read for anyone who loves a quick love story including a rock star </s>","summarize: I loved The Perfect Game Series, J Sterling did a fabulous job on that series so I got extremely excited when I heard she was writting another book.  1. Love the cover.  2. Love J Sterling. 3. Love this new book.

This is an awesome, adorable, lovely storyline. Simple and a quick read. Fun, mystery, shocking, quick love story.....hope there will be more.  I really like Madison and what she's all about. I Love Walker, hot & gorgeous.  Ending was perfect </s>"
271,"Very Highly Recommended, both as a reader and a professional historian of the topic. </s>","summarize: As someone who writes in the area, as both a professional historian and a writer of historical fiction, I can not recommend this book more highly. Stephen Platt's book is a wonderful readable monograph on a fascinating topics.

272,It is not something that is really needed but it comes in useful at times </s>,"summarize: sometimes these things are hard to put together!
It is not something that is really needed but it comes in useful at times.
You don't always detail clean the MK III but you will be glad you have this book when you do.

I bought this book because the first time that I stripped the MK III all the way down it became complicated. I had to call Ruger support up for a walk through to get it back together.  You have to hold the pistol in different orientations as you reassemble it.
This book is a good reference to have in case you forget how to put it back together. </s>"
273,I related to Maggie and Irene and their friendship and I loved solving the murder with them!!! </s>,"summarize: My new favorite author !!!  I read this book twice !! . Bedpans WAS cozy.  I felt like I knew Maggie and Irene.  I felt like they were my friends and I experienced children's antics just like Maggie's kids.
Maggie and Irene's friendship is a hoot, just like me and my friend Debbie.
The book was light, funny, sad, and I was trying to figure out 'who done it'.
Kitty Margo is great.  She created characters I could relate to and I couldn't put it down.
Can't wait for more of Maggie and Irene's mysteries.  Wonder what they will get themselves into next !  Loved it ! </s>"
274,Tsouras's books but I feel like this is one of my favorite books of his </s>,summarize: I have read many of Mr. Tsouras's books but I feel like this is one of my favorite books of his. The greatest clash of arms of the 19th century spanned across both sides of the Atlantic and the timeline of this book will leave your mind reeling from how genius it is. I throughly enjoyed this series and I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the Civil War or American history. </s>
275,"Should be taught in schools, starting with all history classes </s>","summarize: I didn't know lynching was this bad.  To hear about it, is one thing.  To see it, is quite another, especially the faces of the witnesses who enjoy it.  Those who would witness a hanging, and enjoy it, unfortunately, have children that grow up to be just like their parents and we wonder why our world is so messed up.  I think if these were shown in schools, to the older children, maybe they will learn compassion and ensure that it won't happen in the future. </s>"
276,This book and  series makes FOTJ series look like childs play </s>,summarize: Quiet possibly the best star wars book I have ever read. The transformation of dessel to darth bane is pure genius. At the time i read this book it was the very first book in the timeline of the star wars universe for books. I thought that i might as well start here and im glad i did. I compare all the star wars books to this series and nothing has matched it though some have come close. If all the star wars books were half this good there would be way more readers. </s>
277,I bought this book for my wife but I'm going to keep it for myself </s>,"summarize: Wow!  What a surprisingly informative book.  When I first ran across this book I bought it for my wife because she's into this sort of thing.  But now that I've read it I'm getting more out of this than I thought.  Being a guy, I did not really have any interest in oils but this book changed my whole opinion on this topic .  I had no idea what oils could do for you.  I'm a changed man.  :)  I'm recommending this for my entire family and all of my friends. </s>"
278,"Introducing Turing Hopper, an Artificial Intellegence Personality </s>","summarize: Not as funny as the other Donna Andrews mystery series, but offers a real discussion on what is human, what is intelligence, what is a sentient being, and how this should inform laws.  Plus some modern reality in the ideas of programming, a-i, hacking, databases, privacy.

The first in the series.  It would probably be less confusing to read them in order, as a villain and several protagonist characters seems to reappear or be mentioned later in the series </s>"
279,Should be required reading for law enforcment officers and family members </s>,"summarize: Exceptionally well written; Great insight to issues w/ law enforcement.  Dr. Gilmartin is a clinical psychologist that has 20yrs experience in a Sheriff's department.  So he knows from whence he speaks. ""Real"" language quotes, so not for the exceptionally sensitive.

When you understand the dramatic highs and lows of the officer's emotional life it helps you to ""take the bull by the horns"" and deal with it, if your heart is in it. </s>"
280,Great combination of romance/adventure novel and history lesson </s>,"summarize: Great combination of romance/adventure novel and history lesson.  I enjoyed it immensely and got an inside look at World War II preparations and actions in England, Germany,Japan and America. It includes fictitious figures, but also a great deal about Churchill, Hitler, Roosevelt, Stalin, etc. I have just started War and Remembrance, which continues the saga after Pearl Harbor.. </s>"
281,Gripping story of a group of womens struggle ot survive during Spanish Civil War </s>,summarize: Well written story of a group of women  who with the support of each other faced hardship and mental and physical challenges. The story switches between the '80's and 30's as a present day young women seeks to find the artist who painted a mysterious painting found in her grandmothers attic. She is even more puzzled why her grandmother refuses to speak about the circumstsnces by which she acquired the painting. </s>
282,... because I live in Bill Crider's hometown but I enjoy every Dan Rhodes that he writes </s>,summarize: It may be because I live in Bill Crider's hometown but I enjoy every Dan Rhodes that he writes.  I eagerly await the next one.  The question above asked if there was violence in the story.  Does bull riding in the Wal Mart parking lot count?  I find his books are great to curl up with a good glass of your favorite beverage (iced tea or the Sherriff's Dr. Pepper) and lose yourself in Blacklin County.  Always worth the money and time. </s>
283,A compelling story of the people behind the tragedy of Chernobyl </s>,"summarize: This book draws you in and offers a perspective impossible to see from the news coverage. At the time it was an awful scary thing in a far away place but hard to relate to here in the USA. It's definitely worth reading. I feel like I have a glimpse into the experience the Russian people actually lived through, sad but compelling. </s>"
284,You'll Share the Same Emotions about New Mexico as These Authors Do </s>,"summarize: Although many of these essays are very old, native and adopted New Mexicans (like myself) will find that these authors share many of one's own feelings and emotions about the state.  My favorite is the essay in which the author wrote that his family cheered each time they crossed the border into New Mexico in their car after being gone for a while.  This is EXACTLY what my family and I have done since we began our ""love affair"" with the Land of Enchantment almost 50 years ago! </s>"
285,thinking the book summary made it sound sad. Although there is a little sadness </s>,"summarize: I was hesitant to read this, thinking the book summary made it sound sad.  Although there is a little sadness, there wasn't very much, and it was my kind of story - action/adventure with romance thrown in.  I did think it took really too long for the main character to finally take action, but when she did, it was great.  The romance between the 2 main characters does a great job of building slowly, adding to the anticipation and suspense in the book.  I can't wait now for the 2nd book! </s>"
286,A great work of historical fiction with an intriguing story line. </s>,"summarize: As a student of history, especially European history, The Boy Who Wanted Wings was hard to put down from start to finish. It's a great work of fiction with an intriguing story line and lots of well researched historical facts. Another superb book by James Conroyd Martin, author of The Poland Trilogy. </s>"
287,"If you have ever said, ""I hate golf, but I love it"", buy this book! </s>","summarize: ok, I have to admit it...this book was written for me.  All of the silly faults that he points out that derive from thinking that you really want to get under the golf ball, I suffer from.  Chapter after chapter, I was saying  ""so that's why I am having that problem!""  When I took this advice to the driving range, I began to witness the results he described.  I wish I could recommend it to my friends, but then I would have to admit to my golf buddies that I have been playing golf wrong for the past ten years. </s>"
288,Great book for someone (or group) who want to learn how to paint! </s>,"summarize: I was looking for a book for my grandchildren to use for 'painting lessons' from their Great Grandma.  There were a couple in the book that were suitable, but it would probably work even better for a 'Wine & Design' party or for anyone who wanted to follow step by step how to paint something.  The pictures were great and the directions were very clear. </s>"
289,We read this book every night around the dinner table. Great conversation starters! </s>,"summarize: We read this devotional every night around the dinner table. Great conversation starters! My 8YO and 6YO have started asking us to read it if we forget. Most of the time the topics and questions are age appropriate. Occasionally we skip a question if it's too complex. But honestly, that's one of the things I like most is that these are real-life spiritual conversations and we will get to use this book for years to come. Highly recommend! </s>"
290,Grisham does a good job describing Death Row and all its ramifications </s>,summarize: Emotional and Informative.  This book will stay with you for a while.  Grisham does a good job describing Death Row and all its ramifications.  He also goes into detail how some prosecutors will go to any means to get a confession from a suspected criminal.  The minister involved is also described how he deals with several crisis in the story.  A good read. </s>
291,An insightful book with simple tools we can all use to improve our lives. </s>,"summarize: An insightful book with simple tools we can all use to improve our lives. My first experiences with releasing trapped emotions were positive with noticeable and lasting changes. As I read the book, it fit with my view of God and the universe. I'll be returning to the concepts repeatedly. His chapter on muscle testing was the most comprehensive discussion I have seen on the topic. </s>"
292,Great book for people who need detailed photos and instructions but very simply put I actually could power </s>,summarize: I started picking out chapters but then I realized I needed to start from the beginning because I keep blocking out the phone and it goes to Voice control because I was holding the keys down too long I need a softer touch but this book Legion through everything in detail and I had to start from the beginning to calm down when the phone did something buti'll get used to it it's been three weeks and I'm just starting to use the park so I learned a lot of little things that the phone does that is absolutely amazing probably too much </s>
293,"An exciting read of memorizing and unbelievable acts of courage, determination, and exploration. </s>","summarize: Fascinating! I've gone through this book twice, as well as the companion book The Blue Nile. Moorehead weaves the stories of various explorers over several decades seamlessly. This book is exciting to read and memorizing in the recounting of unbelievable acts of courage, determination, and exploration. </s>"
294,Have read the paperback version many times; finding it in Kindle is a delight </s>,"summarize: This character driven sage of religious, political, and social intrigue is set in a highly structured Asian-style world that takes your breath away as you become immersed in it. Complex motivations, hidden agendas, and purity of spirit play together to entrance the reader. Now I can take Initiate Brother Shuyun, Lady Nishima, and Lord Shonto Motoru and the cast of thousands with me where  I go. I could not be more delightfully accompanied. </s>"
295,Book 3 ...an excellent continuation of the Clifton Chronicles! </s>,"summarize: Jeffrey Archer has become one of my go to writers.  His story telling never disappoints.  Have loved this series and anxious for the next book.  Very easy to pick up where the last book left off.  Characters and plot line very well developed.  If you are just starting book one you will want to read straight thru to the last book.... WONDERFUL!!!  Just wish he could write faster....

In all his novels, he grabs you right away and doesn't let go until the last page..... </s>"
296,A fascinating look at an early instance of state sponsored terrorism </s>,"summarize: A foreign country recruits agents in America to set bombs and spread death and mayhem. A Middle Eastern country during the War on Terror? In this case it is Imperial Germany shortly before the United States entered World War I. A gripping account that would make a great Tom Clancy novel, if the late technothriller writer had done historical fiction. </s>"
297,"Mystery, romance and a little supernatural create a great book! </s>","summarize: First, let me say that I received this book free for a honest review. I really enjoyed this book. The character has a supernatural ability that I have not read about before and that was a treat. The book has a nice storyline and cleanly brings a cute possible love interest into our character's life. I really came to care about all the characters. With a twist towards latter half of the book, it leaves me hoping there will be a second book! </s>"
298,... again and brought Mackinac Island to life with a wonderful description of it natural beauty and uniqueness </s>,"summarize: Duffy Brown has done it again and brought Mackinac Island to life with a wonderful description of it natural beauty and uniqueness.
.Her main character Evie Bloomfield and her friends provide us with not only a good laugh but also fun trying to solve this cozy mystery. With a hint of gossip, romance, solving planning a wedding and finding a murder. The characters band together in a special way known to a small community where they look out for their own and their adopted new population. I highly recommend this book and all the Duffy Brown books as they are all wonderful entertainment. </s>"
299,"who thinks she is so outrageously funny, and wanted to get into reading more </s>","summarize: I will start with saying that Chelsea's TV show is too raw for me to watch but I bought this book for my brother, who thinks she is so outrageously funny, and wanted to get into reading more.  I thought I'd read the first chapter to check it out before I visited my brother and gave him the book. Well, I was hooked from page 1. Ladies, I tell you this book is ""pee your pants"" funny!  Outrageous and if all the chapters are real life, I would definitely recommend she see a psychologist, no offense meant. Highly entertaining. </s>"
300,"An exciting Sea Yarn, from the point of view of the Superior race and class </s>","summarize: A wealthy and world-weary young American takes passage on a a sailing vessel around the Horn of South America.  From the treatment of the scum they have for crew, it's no wonder there's a mutiny.  This book deserves a different ending, for by the time most of the crisis passes, the modern reader's sympathy lies with the scum. </s>"
301,I found the complexity of the characters wonderful. I wasn't really sure what to expect </s>,"summarize: This was my first read of Ms. Edwards.  I have to say I found it to be extremely well written, and had some twists that did surprise me.  I found the complexity of the characters wonderful.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I am glad I went into this read without knowing.  I didn't see the story ending as it did.  I tend to get a tad bit cranky when one ends in the way it did.... SO onward to book 2. 4.3/5 </s>"
302,"Good conclusion to the series, copy I bought was a bit beat up though </s>","summarize: I bought this to complete the Icerigger trilogy set in paperback (already had the first two). The book was a bit worn, but its over twenty years old so not too unexpected. I was hoping for a bit better quality based on the quality level it was listed as, but it would be hard to get a used copy of this now in really good condition so I'm satisfied.

Big fan of almost every novel ever written by Alan Dean Foster (except the Pip and Flinx novels, which never really caught my interest). He has a very creative mind and I treasure his work. </s>"
303,Not a beach read but still a good read while you're on the beach </s>,"summarize: Moby Dick is in the canon of English literature.  It's something you are required to read in high school or college.  This is not a condensed book.  You may be surprised that Moby Dick ruined Melville's writing career in his lifetime - he sailed too close to the wind of his contemporary culture.  There is still a lot to learn about Melville, whaling, and the history of literary criticism of this novel. </s>"
304,But it lacked the urgency of a good thriller or detective story </s>,summarize: this is a well written book that makes you feel invited into the detectives family and the charms of Venice. it is thoughtful and thought provoking. But it lacked the urgency of a good thriller or detective story . i felt a little bit dissastisfied as the storyline was a bit weak. But it was very readable and had lovely touches of humour . </s>

For some reason, when you go to the Hofmann-translation book page and click ""Kindle Edition,"" it takes you to this version with a red and black cover that was NOT translated by Hofmann. But hidden away in the ""Other Fomats"" menu on the book page is a second Kindle edition, which IS the one translated by Hofmann, and that's what I have linked to here.

307,"Okay read, but not the classic thrill ride I had been promised. </s>","summarize: I was really hoping for a terrifying read from what I'd heard and have to admit the first fifty pages got me excited...but from there on it was detour after detour (some frightening, I'll admit, but over-all, just filler to make one or two small story advancements.)  When I finally reached the final ending...there were several, I was actually tired of the narrative and didn't really care about anyone. </s>"
308,A most fitting and wonderful end to this most enchanting story </s>,"summarize: Seriously Mr. Koontz, you did not disappoint us, not one bit.  These Odd Thomas stories have been my favorites of all your works (and that's saying something because I have read nearly all of them).  When I saw that you were coming out with an ending chapter to Oddie`s stories , I was hoping for several things to happen and ss I said, you did not disappoint!  I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't yet read this book, but i must say to those folks - why not?!? </s>"
309,The Zombie Man lives to fight another day (well kind of lives)! </s>,"summarize: Zombie man is quite an amusing read.  I can only picture how I would react if I saw someone rip off his leg and hit someone with it!  The rhymes are quite amusing as Pat Hatt seems to always strive to make these short stories rhyme.  His drawings are always interesting to see and his creativity is never ending.  Thanks for yet another one of your books.  Before long we will have read all of them, it is going to be hard for the kid to choose his favorite one!  Thanks again! </s>"
310,I really enjoyed the entire series along with the B&S Series #1 </s>,"summarize: I really enjoyed the entire series along with the B&S Series #1.5, #2.5 and #3.5. I originally got ""Where I Need to Be"" (B&S Series Book 1) as a free book. Loved the first book so much I decided to purchased the set to also get Books 2 and 3, along with #1.5, #2.5 and #3.5 and read everything in order. I had a hard time putting my iPad down! </s>"
311,The Last Train Home (Christmas......) Very Interesting Read - Christmas aside. </s>,"summarize: This is a good read that was well written.  It does have to do around the Christmas season,  but is a interesting read anytime.  It has some strange twists and turns in it that will keep you going.  You will like the characters and how the story flows.  I recommend this book just for it's uniqueness. </s>"
312,The people of Henry Adams are the kind of people I would loved have as my neighbors </s>,summarize: I have read all of The Blessing Novels and Bernadine Brown is a force to be reckoned with.  The people of Henry Adams are the kind of people I would loved have as my neighbors.  If the world could be like Henry Adam's we would live in a much better place.  I await my return to Henry Adams and the good people there. </s>
313,and politics on the level of or better than the Harry Potter series </s>,"summarize: I gave this book a try because of the user reviews despite not being completely sold on the description and am grateful I did. For a book of it's type (fantasy / action) the plot is surprisingly detailed and complex. It builds a world of magic, characters, and politics on the level of or better than the Harry Potter series. The author uses an truly astounding level of detail when building the back story to the various events, and uses a variety of writing techniques that makes a reader forget it is only a book. It is well worth the read. </s>"
314,"Very good read, but inconclusive ending leaves one with questions </s>","summarize: I just finished this book, and it was very good, as all the Alan Gregory series books are.  The ending was a bit of a stretch, but still pretty exciting.  Leaves some unanswered questions, though, so I guess I'll have to get the last book to find out what happens.  Sorry to see this series come to an end. I'll miss Alan Gregory and Sam Purdy! </s>"
315,To Border or Not To Border? That is the only question! Because you know your already going to buy it! </s>,"summarize: I always find myself asking ""where did he come up with these ideas?!"" Not only is this book awesome, but you can get it with or without a border! Some people don't like coloring to the edge of the page while others feel it not complete unless they do. Now you can have it your way! Great details inside. Coloring is about the fun, but also about personal challenge. You need to grab this book and take it to the next level! </s>"
316,You'll divide the world by pre and post once you read this book </s>,"summarize: Larry Keeley and the team at Doblin will change your view of the world. Ten Types of Innovation is the business innovation playbook that will give you a vocabulary for change. You can read headlines and articles in the Wall Street Journal for years...and not understand what's playing out in front of you. Read ""Ten Types"" and you'll gain a perspective that simply impossible without it. The most powerful diagnostic tool I've seen in years. </s>"
317,The book gives a brilliant description of on-going mental illness </s>,"summarize: I have very mixed feelings about Hamsun's ""Mysteries"".  The book gives a brilliant description of on-going mental illness.  Hamsun's presentation is gripping, Nagel's suicide the logical conclusion.  However, I found this novel to be very unpleasant reading; it is just too gruesome.  Five stars for the writing, two for the reading experience. </s>"
318,... and Other Things We Lost is not only an amazing love story </s>,"summarize: Paper Planes and Other Things We Lost is not only an amazing love story, but a poignant story of loss and healing. Ruby's quirkiness and her cursing polish grandmother were two of my favorite characters. The prose and story are both captivating and beautiful. I think Miller and Hayes may be my favorite writing partnership to date!
Even though this is the first book in a series, it can be read as a standalone. </s>"
319,good book for beginner to intermediate level to learn the crochet </s>,"summarize: This book will give a idea of crochet and how some one can decorate various things like clothes,home wares, using the instruction given in the book. But I feel the book can bring more interest if the author puts some real picture of  actual decoration. The techniques can be useful for a beginner or a intermediate level in design. </s>"
320,"Another Fabulous Peter May page turning mystery, a must read! </s>","summarize: As all of the many other books I've read by Peter May, I was a gripped from the start, reading late into the nights just to finish the story. Well written, well researched and enjoyable. If by chance you like the history of Scotland and immigration to Canada don't miss this. The only problem with this book is that I have finished it, sorry to leave the characters now, that I have them in my heart. </s>"
321,"This is Another of the Author's more ""butch"" Characters, But I Love Them All </s>","summarize: Another fun story from Nora. The female lead in this novel is an arson investigator. That is fine, but I sometimes feel that when the author focuses on a female character with sort of a traditionally butch job that she tries too hard to convince us that a woman can do what use to be mens work and still be straight and sometimes girly. The plot is exciting and fast paced, and the book is filled with many likable characters. As always, any fan of Noras (such as me) will love this book.
Michael Travis Jasper, Author of the Novel To Be Chosen </s>"
322,Keith is absolutely right!  Its would be even funnier if it wasn't so serious. </s>,"summarize: Am not far into it yet but I have been enlightened, enraged, and amused by Keith's monologues.  I'm totally with him in his condemnation of the White House squatter trump.  The book provides a clear running commentary of the evil and cruel nature of trump and his enablers.  Keith is passionate, funny, and a great example of how everyone should be taking notice of the rapid destruction of social and ethical norms of government. </s>"
323,Only for those who like to read about wives and daughters being horribly abused. </s>,"summarize: Dreadfully disappointed.  I felt the author did not even try to match the voice and times from 200 years ago.  People should also be aware that the book's heroine suffers vile abuse, which likely did happen, but is hardly appropriate for this genre.  Overall, clunky, depressing, and not worth the time. </s>"
324,"The vile and the nobel, nothing in between -- by H.J. Bershady </s>","summarize: The book is semi-autobiographical.  It's written in the usual Jack London style -- strong verbs, unshaded emotions,  characters that are either good or bad, sharply drawn scenes,  political ideas rarely discussed in his other books, and an ending that is meant to be tragic, but perhaps also or inadvertently reveals the emotional immaturity of the hero.  Its appeal will be greater for younger [people and literary historians -- and for
those who, like me, read it when they were 14 or15 years old and were piqued by something 50 or 60 years later to want to re-read it. </s>"
325,... started to read this series thinking they might be like the Joe Nesbo Harry Hole series </s>,"summarize: I started to read this series thinking they might be like the Joe Nesbo Harry Hole series, and I found them to be similar.  I suggest the series be read starting with this book.  Most of the characters in this book carry over into the rest of the series.  Unfortunately they were available  in the backwards order, so I read the series backwards.  The whole series, I'm sure, would work better if read in the right order.

The books are not like the TV series. </s>"
326,"This book is more of a curriculum guide for teachers, not a history book for kids to read. </s>","summarize: I thought this would be a good book for my boys to read, based on the title. Good thing they allow you to peek inside. This book is definitely a guide for teachers and parents to use to teach history to your kid. I want a nice history book written for a child reader who is interested in reading about history. The title of this book should let readers know this is a guide. </s>"
327,Okay in terms of identifying spots in Oregon/Washington but sparse on details </s>,"summarize: Oregon is full of great spots to visit, some day trips from Portland, others a longer stay. (Note: I'm focusing on Oregon because I live in the Portland area; I know much less about Seattle/Washington.) This book certainly hits the highlights in Oregon and does a pretty good job of laying things out so that you know how much time you should plan for each particular excursion. However, I felt like it doesn't offer enough details on what's interesting about the trips -- especially when it comes to the downtown Portland section. </s>"
328,"Beautiful scenery, wonderful characters, a dead body, and a wedding. </s>","summarize: Beautiful scenery, wonderful characters, a dead body, and a wedding.

Karen MacInerney has pinned another winner. This sixth book in the Gray Whale Inn Mystery series may just be the best in the series so far.

DEATH RUNS ADRIFT was a story that kept adding twists and turns like a winding county road. Each chapter bringing a new surprise. I never knew what was coming next. And thats just how I like my mysteries.

This return trip to Maines Cranberry Island was a pleasure for me for sure and I look forward to my next visit. </s>"
329,but it feels like there is less action and more soul-searching </s>,"summarize: A worthy installment in the series, certainly, but it feels like there is less action and more soul-searching. I prefer the action. The author certainly has creativity, dreaming up audacious escapades for his band of nautical mercenaries. Good to see him beating up on the Russians. I will happily continue to follow the continuing voyages... </s>"
330,Sent it back. Very few pictures and you can get the same or better for free on line </s>,"summarize: Sent it back.  What makes a cook book interesting and excites me to try the recipes are pictures and easy to follow directions.  The directions were fine, but without pictures... .  In addition, it is more and more difficult to find a cook book that is worth paying for given what is available for free on line. </s>"
331,Are you searching for freedom? Author Gowdy is leading the way </s>,"summarize: Are you looking for freedom?
Author Kim Gowdy is bravely leading th way in Freedom Fighters and Truth Tellers. Kim opens her heart and life to lead us on a the journey to unlock the our hidden mess so we can be free to live rich, full lives. Kim uses biblical truths from her practical toolbox to prod us, encourage and inspire us to become the person God designed us to be. I can hear God whispering to me through the pages of Kim's pen and heart.
Do you want to be free?
If you do, grab Freedom Fighters and Truth Tellers. </s>"
332,"For the curious, or concerned about fostering practical thinking among children, you need this book! </s>","summarize: This is the original work; the author has since done a couple of modern versions incorporating more current technology.  But whether you have kids, grand-kids, or are just innately & insanely curious - you need to have this book.  It's incredibly entertaining & should be a permanent part of your shelf, so try & locate others to give away/pass along.  It's important these days, more than ever, because many of the principles upon which we understand the ""why"" of how things work are seldom taught in schools, if at all. </s>"
333,"Exotic tastes - some simple, some a little time consuming, but all delicious! </s>","summarize: I have 3 of her slow cooker books and love each of them.
It is not the same old recipes where you pretty much empty out the fridge into the slow cooker.
A good variety of tastes and recipes. I have only come across one so far that I didn't care for too
much, but I tweaked that recipe a bit and still use it.

I would definitely recommend her cookbooks. </s>"
334,Very honest and real account of the practices within this cult </s>,summarize: Very real look into the cult ways of Scientology from someone who is deeply connected to very important people in it. It does not come across as written by someone who is just bitter at Scientology for any reasons. She is painfully honest with how things are run and her experiences within this horrible organization. </s>
335,A Timeless Classic for the Child Who Loves Vehicles and Equipment </s>,"summarize: This was read to me as a small child, and it is timeless. One of my grand-children is showing clear signs of being an equipment-kid, and I bought this for him. It is timeless, and carries a special positive message about joy, disappointment, and the meaning of life. I remembered that from all those years ago, and believe it contributed to my own growth. </s>"
336,... Sherlock Holmes mysteries that fans of those stories will love it. Carefully thought out and well-written </s>,"summarize: So reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes mysteries that fans of those stories will love it.  Carefully thought out and well-written.  It brings to life the innocence of another age before DNA testing, fingerprinting, and ballistics when the human brain had to figure all these things out.  An entertaining read. </s>"
337,A story of occupied France and the effects on people and families. </s>,"summarize: The nightingale is the code name for a spy in the underground French resistance.  I usually love everything Kristin Hannah writes and this one is no exception. It is the story of families, one in particular, and how the Nazi occupation affects them all.  The characters are well developed as are the times and the settings. I recommend this book. Not only did I really enjoy the story but I learned some things about occupied France. </s>"
338,A long trip can be boring.  This one is definitely not boring. </s>,"summarize: This couple let us see the country through their very bright eyes.  They gave us the perspective of interesting people at every income level and cultural origin.  They took some chances that most would not.  In spite of the warning about their marriage surviving a trip in such tight quarters, their marriage survived and blossomed.  If you like travel books, this is one of the best.

Jim M. </s>"
339,"A hero named Bubba, hunting monsters - what more do you need to know? </s>","summarize: Once you read one of the stories, you get the drift. Fast paced, entertaining and light. Caught a few typos and continuity glitches here and there. There is a certain continuity between the stories, but that means a few paragraphs in each, reviewing what has previously transpired. Good for occasional light entertainment, but I don't think anyone is going to sit down and read the whole series, start to finish. </s>"
340,First I have to say I love everything Willow Winters has written </s>,"summarize: I voluntarily read an ARC of this book.

First I have to say I love everything Willow Winters has written. This book was no exception. Holy crap! I don't know what to say, it was dark and raw and intense and captivating. I totally fell in love with Kade and Olivia. Their story is so crazy and powerful. Such a good book! I'm speechless! </s>"
341,but it certainly hasn't lost its ability to delight and entertain </s>,"summarize: This might be the fourth book in the series, but it certainly hasn't lost its ability to delight and entertain. I found myself shaking my head in acknowledgement of the familiar antics of this outspoken family, and even caught myself chuckling many times. Clair Cook manages to give this story a nice fresh coat that keeps the reader interested and involved in the real world issues of Sarah, John and their family and friends.  Sometimes thought provoking, at other times hilarious, Must Love Dogs Bark & Roll Forever left me wanting to continue on the journey with the Hurlihy family. </s>"
